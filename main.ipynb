            "mma by ane usten mma oodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her he was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate indulgent father and had in consequence of her sister s marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period er mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection ixteen years had iss aylor been in r oodhouse s family less as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters but particularly of mma etween them it was more the intimacy of sisters ven before iss aylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and mma doing just what she liked highly esteeming iss aylor s judgment but directed chiefly by her own he real evils indeed of mma s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments he danger however was at present so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her orrow came a gentle sorrow but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness iss aylor married t was iss aylor s loss which first brought grief t was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that mma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance he wedding over and the bride people gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening er father composed himself to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost he event had every promise of happiness for her friend r eston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self denying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it was a black morning s work for her he want of iss aylor would be felt every hour of every day he recalled her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen years how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed sabella s marriage on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection he had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent well informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hers one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault ow was she to bear the change t was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them but mma was aware that great must be the difference between a rs eston only half a mile from them and a iss aylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude he dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her e could not meet her in conversation rational or playful he evil of the actual disparity in their ages and r oodhouse had not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time er sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony being settled in ondon only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach and many a long ctober and ovember evening must be struggled through at artfield before hristmas brought the next visit from sabella and her husband and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant society again ighbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town to which artfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and name did really belong afforded her no equals he oodhouses were first in consequence there ll looked up to them he had many acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of iss aylor for even half a day t was a melancholy change and mma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful is spirits required support e was a nervous man easily depressed fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating change of every kind atrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter s marrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection when he was now obliged to part with iss aylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think iss aylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at artfield mma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner oor iss aylor wish she were here again hat a pity it is that r eston ever thought of her cannot agree with you papa you know cannot r eston is such a good humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife and you would not have had iss aylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own house of her own ut where is the advantage of a house of her own his is three times as large nd you have never any odd humours my dear ow often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us e shall be always meeting e must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon y dear how am to get so far andalls is such a distance could not walk half so far o papa nobody thought of your walking e must go in the carriage to be sure he carriage ut ames will not like to put the horses to for such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit hey are to be put into r eston s stable papa ou know we have settled all that already e talked it all over with r eston last night nd as for ames you may be very sure he will always like going to andalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else hat was your doing papa ou got annah that good place obody thought of annah till you mentioned her ames is so obliged to you am very glad did think of her t was very lucky for would not have had poor ames think himself slighted upon any account and am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil pretty spoken girl have a great opinion of her henever see her she always curtseys and asks me how do in a very pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needlework observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great comfort to poor iss aylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see henever ames goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us e will be able to tell her how we all are mma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own he backgammon table was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary r nightley a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of sabella s husband e lived about a mile from ighbury was a frequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in ondon e had returned to a late dinner after some days absence and now walked up to artfield to say that all were well in runswick quare t was a happy circumstance and animated r oodhouse for some time r nightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after poor sabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily hen this was over r oodhouse gratefully observed t is very kind of you r nightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us am afraid you must have had a shocking walk ot at all sir t is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that must draw back from your great fire ut you must have found it very damp and dirty wish you may not catch cold irty sir ook at my shoes ot a speck on them ell that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here t rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast wanted them to put off the wedding y the bye have not wished you joy eing pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling have been in no hurry with my congratulations but hope it all went off tolerably well ow did you all behave ho cried most h poor iss aylor is a sad business oor r and iss oodhouse if you please but cannot possibly say poor iss aylor have a great regard for you and mma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence t any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two specially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature said mma playfully hat is what you have in your head know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by believe it is very true my dear indeed said r oodhouse with a sigh am afraid am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome y dearest papa ou do not think could mean you or suppose r nightley to mean you hat a horrible idea h no meant only myself r nightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it is all a joke e always say what we like to one another r nightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults in mma oodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to mma herself she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body mma knows never flatter her said r nightley but meant no reflection on any body iss aylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one he chances are that she must be a gainer ell said mma willing to let it pass you want to hear about the wedding and shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly very body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen h no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day ear mma bears every thing so well said her father ut r nightley she is really very sorry to lose poor iss aylor and am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for mma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles t is impossible that mma should not miss such a companion said r nightley e should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to iss aylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at iss aylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure very friend of iss aylor must be glad to have her so happily married nd you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said mma and a very considerable one that made the match myself made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said r eston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing r nightley shook his head at her er father fondly replied h my dear wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass ray do not make any more matches promise you to make none for myself papa but must indeed for other people t is the greatest amusement in the world nd after such success you know very body said that r eston would never marry again h dear no r eston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful r eston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it h no r eston certainly would never marry again ome people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him ll manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but believed none of it ver since the day about four years ago that iss aylor and met with him in roadway ane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from armer itchell s made up my mind on the subject planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that shall leave off match making do not understand what you mean by success said r nightley uccess supposes endeavour our time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage worthy employment for a young lady s mind ut if which rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day think it would be a very good thing for iss aylor if r eston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success here is your merit hat are you proud of ou made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said nd have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess pity you thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck here is always some talent in it nd as to my poor word success which you quarrel with do not know that am so entirely without any claim to it ou have drawn two pretty pictures but think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all f had not promoted r eston s visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all think you must know artfield enough to comprehend that straightforward open hearted man like eston and a rational unaffected woman like iss aylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns ou are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference mma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others rejoined r oodhouse understanding but in part ut my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one s family circle grievously nly one more papa only for r lton oor r lton ou like r lton papa must look about for a wife for him here is nobody in ighbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him think very well of r lton and this is the only way have of doing him a service r lton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and have a great regard for him ut if you want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come and dine with us some day hat will be a much better thing dare say r nightley will be so kind as to meet him ith a great deal of pleasure sir at any time said r nightley laughing and agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing nvite him to dinner mma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife epend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself r eston was a native of ighbury and born of a respectable family which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property e had received a good education but on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied aptain eston was a general favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to iss hurchill of a great orkshire family and iss hurchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend iss hurchill however being of age and with the full command of her fortune though her fortune bore no proportion to the family estate was not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it took place to the infinite mortification of r and rs hurchill who threw her off with due decorum t was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much happiness rs eston ought to have found more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit she had not the best he had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother s unreasonable anger nor from missing the luxuries of her former home hey lived beyond their income but still it was nothing in comparison of nscombe she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of aptain eston and iss hurchill of nscombe aptain eston who had been considered especially by the hurchills as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst of the bargain for when his wife died after a three years marriage he was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain rom the expense of the child however he was soon relieved he boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother s been the means of a sort of reconciliation and r and rs hurchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the little rank soon after her decease ome scruples and some reluctance the widower father may be supposed to have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the hurchills and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to improve as he could complete change of life became desirable e quitted the militia and engaged in trade having brothers already established in a good way in ondon which afforded him a favourable opening t was a concern which brought just employment enough e had still a small house in ighbury where most of his leisure days were spent and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away e had by that time realised an easy competence enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining ighbury which he had always longed for enough to marry a woman as portionless even as iss aylor and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition t was now some time since iss aylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase andalls and the sale of andalls was long looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were accomplished e had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through e had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it e had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was his own for as to rank it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle s heir it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of hurchill on coming of age t was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his father s assistance is father had no apprehension of it he aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely but it was not in r eston s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear e saw his son every year in ondon and was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made ighbury feel a sort of pride in him too e was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern r rank hurchill was one of the boasts of ighbury and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life is coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved ow upon his father s marriage it was very generally proposed as a most proper attention that the visit should take place here was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when rs erry drank tea with rs and iss ates or when rs and iss ates returned the visit ow was the time for r rank hurchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion or a few days every morning visit in ighbury included some mention of the handsome letter rs eston had received suppose you have heard of the handsome letter r rank hurchill has written to rs eston understand it was a very handsome letter indeed r oodhouse told me of it r oodhouse saw the letter and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life t was indeed a highly prized letter rs eston had of course formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured he felt herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her he knew that at times she must be missed and could not think without pain of mma s losing a single pleasure or suffering an hour s ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear mma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations nd then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of andalls from artfield so convenient for even solitary female walking and in r eston s disposition and circumstances which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together er situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to rs eston and of moments only of regret and her satisfaction her more than satisfaction her cheerful enjoyment was so just and so apparent that mma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity poor iss aylor when they left her at andalls in the centre of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own ut never did she go without r oodhouse s giving a gentle sigh and saying h poor iss aylor he would be very glad to stay here was no recovering iss aylor nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation to r oodhouse he compliments of his neighbours were over he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event and the wedding cake which had been a great distress to him was all eat up is own stomach could bear nothing rich and he could never believe other people to be different from himself hat was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding cake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly tried to prevent any body s eating it e had been at the pains of consulting r erry the apothecary on the subject r erry was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of r oodhouse s life and upon being applied to he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination that wedding cake might certainly disagree with many perhaps with most people unless taken moderately ith such an opinion in confirmation of his own r oodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone here was a strange rumour in ighbury of all the little errys being seen with a slice of rs eston s wedding cake in their hands but r oodhouse would never believe it r oodhouse was fond of society in his own way e liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at artfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked e had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinner parties made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms ortunately for him ighbury including andalls in the same parish and onwell bbey in the parish adjoining the seat of r nightley comprehended many such ot unfrequently through mma s persuasion he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which mma could not make up a card table for him eal long standing regard brought the estons and r nightley and by r lton a young man living alone without liking it the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of r oodhouse s drawing room and the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being thrown away fter these came a second set among the most come at able of whom were rs and iss ates and rs oddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from artfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that r oodhouse thought it no hardship for either ames or the horses ad it taken place only once a year it would have been a grievance rs ates the widow of a former vicar of ighbury was a very old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille he lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward circumstances can excite er daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young handsome rich nor married iss ates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect he had never boasted either beauty or cleverness er youth had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible nd yet she was a happy woman and a woman whom no one named without good will t was her own universal good will and contented temper which worked such wonders he loved every body was interested in every body s happiness quicksighted to every body s merits thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted for nothing he simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature her contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body and a mine of felicity to herself he was a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited r oodhouse full of trivial communications and harmless gossip rs oddard was the mistress of a chool not of a seminary or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systems and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity but a real honest old fashioned oarding school where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little education without any danger of coming back prodigies rs oddard s school was in high repute and very deservedly for ighbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands t was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church he was a plain motherly kind of woman who had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea visit and having formerly owed much to r oodhouse s kindness felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancy work whenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside hese were the ladies whom mma found herself very frequently able to collect and happy was she for her father s sake in the power though as far as she was herself concerned it was no remedy for the absence of rs eston he was delighted to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated s she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day a note was brought from rs oddard requesting in most respectful terms to be allowed to bring iss mith with her a most welcome request for iss mith was a girl of seventeen whom mma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of her beauty very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion arriet mith was the natural daughter of somebody omebody had placed her several years back at rs oddard s school and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour boarder his was all that was generally known of her history he had no visible friends but what had been acquired at ighbury and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her he was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort which mma particularly admired he was short plump and fair with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening mma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the acquaintance he was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in iss mith s conversation but she found her altogether very engaging not inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to artfield and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement ncouragement should be given hose soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of ighbury and its connexions he acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her he friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort of people must be doing her harm hey were a family of the name of artin whom mma well knew by character as renting a large farm of r nightley and residing in the parish of onwell very creditably she believed she knew r nightley thought highly of them but they must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect he would notice her she would improve her she would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her into good society she would form her opinions and her manners t would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers he was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the in betweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the supper table which always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware ith an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively with the real good will of a mind delighted with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests pon such occasions poor r oodhouses feelings were in sad warfare e loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion of his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat uch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could with thorough self approbation recommend though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say rs ates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs n egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome erle understands boiling an egg better than any body would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you iss ates let mma help you to a little bit of tart a very little bit urs are all apple tarts ou need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here do not advise the custard rs oddard what say you to half a glass of wine small half glass put into a tumbler of water do not think it could disagree with you mma allowed her father to talk but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy he happiness of iss mith was quite equal to her intentions iss oodhouse was so great a personage in ighbury that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which iss oodhouse had treated her all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last arriet mith s intimacy at artfield was soon a settled thing uick and decided in her ways mma lost no time in inviting encouraging and telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased so did their satisfaction in each other s a walking companion mma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her n that respect rs eston s loss had been important er father never went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied and since rs eston s marriage her exercise had been too much confined he had ventured once alone to andalls but it was not pleasant and a arriet mith therefore one whom she could summon at any time to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges ut in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her and was confirmed in all her kind designs arriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to er early attachment to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected ltogether she was quite convinced of arriet mith s being exactly the young friend she wanted exactly the something which her home required uch a friend as rs eston was out of the question wo such could never be granted wo such she did not want t was quite a different sort of thing a sentiment distinct and independent rs eston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem arriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful or rs eston there was nothing to be done for arriet every thing er first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents but arriet could not tell he was ready to tell every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain mma was obliged to fancy what she liked but she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth arriet had no penetration he had been satisfied to hear and believe just what rs oddard chose to tell her and looked no farther rs oddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the school in general formed naturally a great part of the conversation and but for her acquaintance with the artins of bbey ill arm it must have been the whole ut the artins occupied her thoughts a good deal she had spent two very happy months with them and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place mma encouraged her talkativeness amused by such a picture of another set of beings and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of rs artin s having two parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as rs oddard s drawing room and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them lderneys and one a little elch cow a very pretty little elch cow indeed and of rs artin s saying as she was so fond of it it should be called her cow and of their having a very handsome summer house in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink tea a very handsome summer house large enough to hold a dozen people or some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate cause but as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose he had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and daughter a son and son s wife who all lived together but when it appeared that the r artin who bore a part in the narrative and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good nature in doing something or other was a single man that there was no young rs artin no wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she were not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever ith this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number and meaning and she particularly led arriet to talk more of r artin and there was evidently no dislike to it arriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good humoured and obliging e had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them and in every thing else he was so very obliging e had his shepherd s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her he was very fond of singing e could sing a little himself he believed he was very clever and understood every thing e had a very fine flock and while she was with them he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country he believed every body spoke well of him is mother and sisters were very fond of him rs artin had told her one day and there was a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body to be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married he would make a good husband ot that she wanted him to marry he was in no hurry at all ell done rs artin thought mma ou know what you are about nd when she had come away rs artin was so very kind as to send rs oddard a beautiful goose the finest goose rs oddard had ever seen rs oddard had dressed it on a unday and asked all the three teachers iss ash and iss rince and iss ichardson to sup with her r artin suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business e does not read h yes that is no do not know but believe he has read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of e reads the gricultural eports and some other books that lay in one of the window seats but he reads all them to himself ut sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the legant xtracts very entertaining nd know he has read the icar of akefield e never read the omance of the orest nor he hildren of the bbey e had never heard of such books before mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can he next question was hat sort of looking man is r artin h not handsome not at all handsome thought him very plain at first but do not think him so plain now ne does not you know after a time ut did you never see him e is in ighbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to ingston e has passed you very often hat may be and may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity he yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom feel can have nothing to do degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other ut a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it o be sure h yes t is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeed mean by sight have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well hat do you imagine his age to be e was four and twenty the th of last une and my birthday is the rd just a fortnight and a day s difference which is very odd nly four and twenty hat is too young to settle is mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry hey seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it ix years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable ix years hence ear iss oodhouse he would be thirty years old ell and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence r artin imagine has his fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with the world hatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet o be sure so it is ut they live very comfortably hey have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and rs artin talks of taking a boy another year wish you may not get into a scrape arriet whenever he does marry mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice he misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates here can be no doubt of your being a gentleman s daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you es to be sure suppose there are ut while visit at artfield and you are so kind to me iss oodhouse am not afraid of what any body can do ou understand the force of influence pretty well arriet but would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of artfield and iss oodhouse want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore say that if you should still be in this country when r artin marries wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmer s daughter without education o be sure es ot that think r artin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up owever do not mean to set up my opinion against your s and am sure shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife shall always have a great regard for the iss artins especially lizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me ut if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly had better not visit her if can help it mma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech and saw no alarming symptoms of love he young man had been the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious difficulty on arriet s side to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own hey met r artin the very next day as they were walking on the onwell road e was on foot and after looking very respectfully at her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion mma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey and walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with r obert artin is appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in arriet s inclination arriet was not insensible of manner she had voluntarily noticed her father s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder r artin looked as if he did not know what manner was hey remained but a few minutes together as iss oodhouse must not be kept waiting and arriet then came running to her with a smiling face and in a flutter of spirits which iss oodhouse hoped very soon to compose nly think of our happening to meet him ow very odd t was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by andalls e did not think we ever walked this road e thought we walked towards andalls most days e has not been able to get the omance of the orest yet e was so busy the last time he was at ingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to morrow o very odd we should happen to meet ell iss oodhouse is he like what you expected hat do you think of him o you think him so very plain e is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility had no right to expect much and did not expect much but had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air had imagined him confess a degree or two nearer gentility o be sure said arriet in a mortified voice he is not so genteel as real gentlemen think arriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in r artin t artfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with r artin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before o not you begin to feel that now ere not you struck am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which heard to be wholly unmodulated as stood here ertainly he is not like r nightley e has not such a fine air and way of walking as r nightley see the difference plain enough ut r nightley is so very fine a man r nightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare r artin with him ou might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in r nightley ut he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to hat say you to r eston and r lton ompare r artin with either of them ompare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent ou must see the difference h yes there is a great difference ut r eston is almost an old man r eston must be between forty and fifty hich makes his good manners the more valuable he older a person grows arriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes hat is passable in youth is detestable in later age r artin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at r eston s time of life here is no saying indeed replied arriet rather solemnly ut there may be pretty good guessing e will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss ill he indeed hat will be very bad ow much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended e was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else which is just as it should be for a thriving man hat has he to do with books nd have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us wonder he did not remember the book was all arriet s answer and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which mma thought might be safely left to itself he therefore said no more for some time er next beginning was n one respect perhaps r lton s manners are superior to r nightley s or r eston s hey have more gentleness hey might be more safely held up as a pattern here is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in r eston which every body likes in him because there is so much good humour with it but that would not do to be copied either would r nightley s downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits him very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable n the contrary think a young man might be very safely recommended to take r lton as a model r lton is good humoured cheerful obliging and gentle e seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us arriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be f he means any thing it must be to please you id not tell you what he said of you the other day he then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from r lton and now did full justice to and arriet blushed and smiled and said she had always thought r lton very agreeable r lton was the very person fixed on by mma for driving the young farmer out of arriet s head he thought it would be an excellent match and only too palpably desirable natural and probable for her to have much merit in planning it he feared it was what every body else must think of and predict t was not likely however that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of arriet s coming to artfield he longer she considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency r lton s situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself and without low connexions at the same time not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of arriet e had a comfortable home for her and mma imagined a very sufficient income for though the vicarage of ighbury was not large he was known to have some independent property and she thought very highly of him as a good humoured well meaning respectable young man without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world he had already satisfied herself that he thought arriet a beautiful girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at artfield was foundation enough on his side and on arriet s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy nd he was really a very pleasing young man a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like e was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general though not by her there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with but the girl who could be gratified by a obert artin s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by r lton s admiration do not know what your opinion may be rs eston said r nightley of this great intimacy between mma and arriet mith but think it a bad thing bad thing o you really think it a bad thing why so think they will neither of them do the other any good ou surprize me mma must do arriet good and by supplying her with a new object of interest arriet may be said to do mma good have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure ow very differently we feel ot think they will do each other any good his will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about mma r nightley erhaps you think am come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing eston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle r eston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks exactly as do on the subject e were speaking of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for mma that there should be such a girl in ighbury for her to associate with r nightley shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case ou are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used to it all her life can imagine your objection to arriet mith he is not the superior young woman which mma s friend ought to be ut on the other hand as mma wants to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more herself hey will read together he means it know mma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old have seen a great many lists of her drawing up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through and very good lists they were very well chosen and very neatly arranged sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule he list she drew up when only fourteen remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit that preserved it some time and dare say she may have made out a very good list now ut have done with expecting any course of steady reading from mma he will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding here iss aylor failed to stimulate may safely affirm that arriet mith will do nothing ou never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished ou know you could not dare say replied rs eston smiling that thought so then but since we have parted can never remember mma s omitting to do any thing wished here is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that said r nightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done ut he soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must still see hear and remember mma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family t ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen he was always quick and assured sabella slow and diffident nd ever since she was twelve mma has been mistress of the house and of you all n her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her he inherits her mother s talents and must have been under subjection to her should have been sorry r nightley to be dependent on your recommendation had quitted r oodhouse s family and wanted another situation do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body am sure you always thought me unfit for the office held es said he smiling ou are better placed here very fit for a wife but not at all for a governess ut you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at artfield ou might not give mma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if eston had asked me to recommend him a wife should certainly have named iss aylor hank you here will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as r eston hy to own the truth am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne e will not despair however eston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him hope not that t is not likely o r nightley do not foretell vexation from that quarter ot indeed only name possibilities do not pretend to mma s genius for foretelling and guessing hope with all my heart the young man may be a eston in merit and a hurchill in fortune ut arriet mith have not half done about arriet mith think her the very worst sort of companion that mma could possibly have he knows nothing herself and looks upon mma as knowing every thing he is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse because undesigned er ignorance is hourly flattery ow can mma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while arriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority nd as for arriet will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance artfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to he will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home am much mistaken if mma s doctrines give any strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life hey only give a little polish either depend more upon mma s good sense than you do or am more anxious for her present comfort for cannot lament the acquaintance ow well she looked last night h you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you ery well shall not attempt to deny mma s being pretty retty say beautiful rather an you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than mma altogether face and figure do not know what could imagine but confess that have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers ut am a partial old friend uch an eye the true hazle eye and so brilliant regular features open countenance with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure here is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her glance ne hears sometimes of a child being the picture of health now mma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown up health he is loveliness itself r nightley is not she have not a fault to find with her person he replied think her all you describe love to look at her and will add this praise that do not think her personally vain onsidering how very handsome she is she appears to be little occupied with it her vanity lies another way rs eston am not to be talked out of my dislike of arriet mith or my dread of its doing them both harm nd r nightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm ith all dear mma s little faults she is an excellent creature here shall we see a better daughter or a kinder sister or a truer friend o no she has qualities which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong she will make no lasting blunder where mma errs once she is in the right a hundred times ery well will not plague you any more mma shall be an angel and will keep my spleen to myself till hristmas brings ohn and sabella ohn loves mma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection and sabella always thinks as he does except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children am sure of having their opinions with me know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind but excuse me r nightley if take the liberty consider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that mma s mother might have had the liberty of hinting that do not think any possible good can arise from arriet mith s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you ray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that mma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself t has been so many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized r nightley at this little remains of office ot at all cried he am much obliged to you for it t is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found for it shall be attended to rs ohn nightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about her sister e satisfied said he will not raise any outcry will keep my ill humour to myself have a very sincere interest in mma sabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a greater interest perhaps hardly so great here is an anxiety a curiosity in what one feels for mma wonder what will become of her o do said rs eston gently very much he always declares she will never marry which of course means just nothing at all ut have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for t would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object should like to see mma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good ut there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom from home here does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present said rs eston as can well be and while she is so happy at artfield cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor r oodhouse s account do not recommend matrimony at present to mma though mean no slight to the state assure you art of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and r eston s on the subject as much as possible here were wishes at andalls respecting mma s destiny but it was not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition which r nightley soon afterwards made to hat does eston think of the weather shall we have rain convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about artfield mma could not feel a doubt of having given arriet s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of r lton s being a remarkably handsome man with most agreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on arriet s side as there could be any occasion for he was quite convinced of r lton s being in the fairest way of falling in love if not in love already he had no scruple with regard to him e talked of arriet and praised her so warmly that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add is perception of the striking improvement of arriet s manner since her introduction at artfield was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment ou have given iss mith all that she required said he you have made her graceful and easy he was a beautiful creature when she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature am glad you think have been useful to her but arriet only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints he had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself have done very little f it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant r lton have perhaps given her a little more decision of character have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before xactly so that is what principally strikes me o much superadded decision of character kilful has been the hand reat has been the pleasure am sure never met with a disposition more truly amiable have no doubt of it nd it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation which had a vast deal of the lover he was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers to have arriet s picture id you ever have your likeness taken arriet said she did you ever sit for your picture arriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say with a very interesting naivete h dear no never o sooner was she out of sight than mma exclaimed hat an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be would give any money for it almost long to attempt her likeness myself ou do not know it dare say but two or three years ago had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general ut from one cause or another gave it up in disgust ut really could almost venture if arriet would sit to me t would be such a delight to have her picture et me entreat you cried r lton it would indeed be a delight et me entreat you iss oodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend know what your drawings are ow could you suppose me ignorant s not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not rs eston some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room at andalls es good man thought mma but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ou know nothing of drawing on t pretend to be in raptures about mine eep your raptures for arriet s face ell if you give me such kind encouragement r lton believe shall try what can do arriet s features are very delicate which makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch xactly so he shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth have not a doubt of your success ray pray attempt it s you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession ut am afraid r lton arriet will not like to sit he thinks so little of her own beauty id not you observe her manner of answering me ow completely it meant why should my picture be drawn h yes observed it assure you t was not lost on me ut still cannot imagine she would not be persuaded arriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others mma wished to go to work directly and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they might decide together on the best size for arriet er many beginnings were displayed iniatures half lengths whole lengths pencil crayon and water colours had been all tried in turn he had always wanted to do every thing and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to he played and sang and drew in almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of he was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician but she was not unwilling to have others deceived or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved here was merit in every drawing in the least finished perhaps the most her style was spirited but had there been much less or had there been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same hey were both in ecstasies likeness pleases every body and iss oodhouse s performances must be capital o great variety of faces for you said mma had only my own family to study from here is my father another of my father but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that could only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore rs eston again and again and again you see ear rs eston always my kindest friend on every occasion he would sit whenever asked her here is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figure and the face not unlike should have made a good likeness of her if she would have sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet hen here come all my attempts at three of those four children there they are enry and ohn and ella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of them might do for any one of the rest he was so eager to have them drawn that could not refuse but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any of mama s children ever were ere is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see e had nestled down his head most conveniently hat s very like am rather proud of little eorge he corner of the sofa is very good hen here is my last unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size whole length my last and my best my brother r ohn nightley his did not want much of being finished when put it away in a pet and vowed would never take another likeness could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when had really made a very good likeness of it rs eston and were quite agreed in thinking it very like only too handsome too flattering but that was a fault on the right side after all this came poor dear sabella s cold approbation of es it was a little like but to be sure it did not do him justice e had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all t was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than could bear and so never would finish it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in runswick quare and as said did then forswear ever drawing any body again ut for arriet s sake or rather for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present will break my resolution now r lton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea and was repeating o husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as you observe xactly so o husbands and wives with so interesting a consciousness that mma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once ut as she wanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer he had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait t was to be a whole length in water colours like r ohn nightley s and was destined if she could please herself to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece he sitting began and arriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist ut there was no doing any thing with r lton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch he gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence but was really obliged to put an end to it and request him to place himself elsewhere t then occurred to her to employ him in reading f he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness indeed t would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen the irksomeness of iss mith s r lton was only too happy arriet listened and mma drew in peace he must allow him to be still frequently coming to look any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil to jump up and see the progress and be charmed here was no being displeased with such an encourager for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible he could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable he sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite enough pleased with the first day s sketch to wish to go on here was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure to give a little more height and considerably more elegance she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both a standing memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other and the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations as r lton s very promising attachment was likely to add arriet was to sit again the next day and r lton just as he ought entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again y all means e shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party he same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction took place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress of the picture which was rapid and happy very body who saw it was pleased but r lton was in continual raptures and defended it through every criticism iss oodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted observed rs eston to him not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover he expression of the eye is most correct but iss mith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes t is the fault of her face that she has them not o you think so replied he cannot agree with you t appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature never saw such a likeness in my life e must allow for the effect of shade you know ou have made her too tall mma said r nightley mma knew that she had but would not own it and r lton warmly added h no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall onsider she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved you know roportions fore shortening h no it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as iss mith s xactly so indeed t is very pretty said r oodhouse o prettily done ust as your drawings always are my dear do not know any body who draws so well as you do he only thing do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold ut my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer ook at the tree ut it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear ou sir may say any thing cried r lton but must confess that regard it as a most happy thought the placing of iss mith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit ny other situation would have been much less in character he naivete of iss mith s manners and altogether h it is most admirable cannot keep my eyes from it never saw such a likeness he next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a few difficulties t must be done directly it must be done in ondon the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on and sabella the usual doer of all commissions must not be applied to because it was ecember and r oodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of ecember ut no sooner was the distress known to r lton than it was removed is gallantry was always on the alert ight he be trusted with the commission what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it he could ride to ondon at any time t was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand e was too good she could not endure the thought she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances and a very few minutes settled the business r lton was to take the drawing to ondon chuse the frame and give the directions and mma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough hat a precious deposit said he with a tender sigh as he received it his man is almost too gallant to be in love thought mma should say so but that suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love e is an excellent young man and will suit arriet exactly it will be an xactly so as he says himself but he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more than could endure as a principal come in for a pretty good share as a second ut it is his gratitude on arriet s account he very day of r lton s going to ondon produced a fresh occasion for mma s services towards her friend arriet had been at artfield as usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home to return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell alf a minute brought it all out he had heard as soon as she got back to rs oddard s that r artin had been there an hour before and finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away and on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two songs which she had lent lizabeth to copy a letter to herself and this letter was from him from r artin and contained a direct proposal of marriage ho could have thought it he was so surprized she did not know what to do es quite a proposal of marriage and a very good letter at least she thought so nd he wrote as if he really loved her very much but she did not know and so she was come as fast as she could to ask iss oodhouse what she should do mma was half ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful pon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking e will connect himself well if he can ill you read the letter cried arriet ray do d rather you would mma was not sorry to be pressed he read and was surprized he style of the letter was much above her expectation here were not merely no grammatical errors but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman the language though plain was strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer t was short but expressed good sense warm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling he paused over it while arriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion with a ell well and was at last forced to add s it a good letter or is it too short es indeed a very good letter replied mma rather slowly so good a letter arriet that every thing considered think one of his sisters must have helped him can hardly imagine the young man whom saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough for a woman o doubt he is a sensible man and suppose may have a natural talent for thinks strongly and clearly and when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words t is so with some men es understand the sort of mind igorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse better written letter arriet returning it than had expected ell said the still waiting arriet well and and what shall do hat shall you do n what respect o you mean with regard to this letter es ut what are you in doubt of ou must answer it of course and speedily es ut what shall say ear iss oodhouse do advise me h no no the letter had much better be all your own ou will express yourself very properly am sure here is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing our meaning must be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will present themselves unbidden to your mind am persuaded ou need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment ou think ought to refuse him then said arriet looking down ught to refuse him y dear arriet what do you mean re you in any doubt as to that thought but beg your pardon perhaps have been under a mistake certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it arriet was silent ith a little reserve of manner mma continued ou mean to return a favourable answer collect o do not that is do not mean hat shall do hat would you advise me to do ray dear iss oodhouse tell me what ought to do shall not give you any advice arriet will have nothing to do with it his is a point which you must settle with your feelings had no notion that he liked me so very much said arriet contemplating the letter or a little while mma persevered in her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say lay it down as a general rule arriet that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse him f she can hesitate as to es she ought to say o directly t is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with half a heart thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you ut do not imagine that want to influence you h no am sure you are a great deal too kind to but if you would just advise me what had best do o no do not mean that s you say one s mind ought to be quite made up ne should not be hesitating t is a very serious thing t will be safer to say o perhaps o you think had better say o ot for the world said mma smiling graciously would advise you either way ou must be the best judge of your own happiness f you prefer r artin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate ou blush arriet oes any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition arriet arriet do not deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion t this moment whom are you thinking of he symptoms were favourable nstead of answering arriet turned away confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire and though the letter was still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted about without regard mma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes t last with some hesitation arriet said iss oodhouse as you will not give me your opinion must do as well as can by myself and have now quite determined and really almost made up my mind to refuse r artin o you think am right erfectly perfectly right my dearest arriet you are doing just what you ought hile you were at all in suspense kept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decided have no hesitation in approving ear arriet give myself joy of this t would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the consequence of your marrying r artin hile you were in the smallest degree wavering said nothing about it because would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me could not have visited rs obert artin of bbey ill arm ow am secure of you for ever arriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck her forcibly ou could not have visited me she cried looking aghast o to be sure you could not but never thought of that before hat would have been too dreadful hat an escape ear iss oodhouse would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world ndeed arriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you but it must have been ou would have thrown yourself out of all good society must have given you up ear me ow should ever have borne it t would have killed me never to come to artfield any more ear affectionate creature ou banished to bbey ill arm ou confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it e must have a pretty good opinion of himself do not think he is conceited either in general said arriet her conscience opposing such censure at least he is very good natured and shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard for but that is quite a different thing from and you know though he may like me it does not follow that should and certainly must confess that since my visiting here have seen people and if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable owever do really think r artin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to me and his writing such a letter but as to leaving you it is what would not do upon any consideration hank you thank you my own sweet little friend e will not be parted woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter h no and it is but a short letter too mma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a very true and it would be a small consolation to her for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day to know that her husband could write a good letter h yes very obody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions am quite determined to refuse him ut how shall do hat shall say mma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her assistance and though mma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence he looking over his letter again in replying to it had such a softening tendency that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful that mma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment he would have been accepted after all his letter however was written and sealed and sent he business was finished and arriet safe he was rather low all the evening but mma could allow for her amiable regrets and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection sometimes by bringing forward the idea of r lton shall never be invited to bbey ill again was said in rather a sorrowful tone or if you were could ever bear to part with you my arriet ou are a great deal too necessary at artfield to be spared to bbey ill nd am sure should never want to go there for am never happy but at artfield ome time afterwards it was think rs oddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened am sure iss ash would for iss ash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a linen draper ne should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school arriet dare say iss ash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married ven this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes s to any thing superior for you suppose she is quite in the dark he attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of ighbury yet itherto fancy you and are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves arriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering that people should like her so much he idea of r lton was certainly cheering but still after a time she was tender hearted again towards the rejected r artin ow he has got my letter said she softly wonder what they are all doing whether his sisters know if he is unhappy they will be unhappy too hope he will not mind it so very much et us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed cried mma t this moment perhaps r lton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name y picture ut he has left my picture in ond street as he so hen know nothing of r lton o my dear little modest arriet depend upon it the picture will not be in ond street till just before he mounts his horse to morrow t is his companion all this evening his solace his delight t opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm prepossession ow cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are arriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger arriet slept at artfield that night or some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there and gradually getting to have a bed room appropriated to herself and mma judged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her with them as much as possible just at present he was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to rs oddard s but it was then to be settled that she should return to artfield to make a regular visit of some days hile she was gone r nightley called and sat some time with r oodhouse and mma till r oodhouse who had previously made up his mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it and was induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples of his own civility to leave r nightley for that purpose r nightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering by his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other ell believe if you will excuse me r nightley if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing shall take mma s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour s the sun is out believe had better take my three turns while can treat you without ceremony r nightley e invalids think we are privileged people y dear sir do not make a stranger of me leave an excellent substitute in my daughter mma will be happy to entertain you nd therefore think will beg your excuse and take my three turns my winter walk ou cannot do better sir would ask for the pleasure of your company r nightley but am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to onwell bbey hank you sir thank you am going this moment myself and think the sooner you go the better will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you r oodhouse at last was off but r nightley instead of being immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more chat e began speaking of arriet and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than mma had ever heard before cannot rate her beauty as you do said he but she is a pretty little creature and am inclined to think very well of her disposition er character depends upon those she is with but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman am glad you think so and the good hands hope may not be wanting ome said he you are anxious for a compliment so will tell you that you have improved her ou have cured her of her school girl s giggle she really does you credit hank you should be mortified indeed if did not believe had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may ou do not often overpower me with it ou are expecting her again you say this morning lmost every moment he has been gone longer already than she intended omething has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps ighbury gossips iresome wretches arriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would mma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore said nothing e presently added with a smile do not pretend to fix on times or places but must tell you that have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage ndeed how so of what sort very serious sort assure you still smiling ery serious can think of but one thing ho is in love with her ho makes you their confidant mma was more than half in hopes of r lton s having dropt a hint r nightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew r lton looked up to him have reason to think he replied that arriet mith will soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarter obert artin is the man er visit to bbey ill this summer seems to have done his business e is desperately in love and means to marry her e is very obliging said mma but is he sure that arriet means to marry him ell well means to make her an offer then ill that do e came to the bbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it e knows have a thorough regard for him and all his family and believe considers me as one of his best friends e came to ask me whether thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whether thought her too young in short whether approved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society above him was very much pleased with all that he said never hear better sense from any one than obert artin e always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging e told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage e is an excellent young man both as son and brother had no hesitation in advising him to marry e proved to me that he could afford it and that being the case was convinced he could not do better praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy f he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then and dare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had his happened the night before last ow as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at rs oddard s to day and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch ray r nightley said mma who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech how do you know that r artin did not speak yesterday ertainly replied he surprized do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred as not she the whole day with you ome said she will tell you something in return for what you have told me e did speak yesterday that is he wrote and was refused his was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed and r nightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure as he stood up in tall indignation and said hen she is a greater simpleton than ever believed her hat is the foolish girl about h to be sure cried mma it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her onsense a man does not imagine any such thing ut what is the meaning of this arriet mith refuse obert artin madness if it is so but hope you are mistaken saw her answer nothing could be clearer ou saw her answer you wrote her answer too mma this is your doing ou persuaded her to refuse him nd if did which however am far from allowing should not feel that had done wrong r artin is a very respectable young man but cannot admit him to be arriet s equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her y your account he does seem to have had some scruples t is a pity that they were ever got over ot arriet s equal exclaimed r nightley loudly and warmly and with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards o he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation mma your infatuation about that girl blinds you hat are arriet mith s claims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than obert artin he is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations he is known only as parlour boarder at a common school he is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information he has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself t her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her he is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all y only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse ut could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well he advantage of the match felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have now that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck ven your satisfaction made sure of t crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend s leaving ighbury for the sake of her being settled so well remember saying to myself ven mma with all her partiality for arriet will think this a good match cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of mma as to say any such thing hat think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit r artin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend ot regret her leaving ighbury for the sake of marrying a man whom could never admit as an acquaintance of my own wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings assure you mine are very different must think your statement by no means fair ou are not just to arriet s claims hey would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself r artin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society he sphere in which she moves is much above his t would be a degradation degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentleman farmer s to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called obody it will not hold in common sense he is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up here can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of fortune er allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort hat she is a gentleman s daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen s daughters no one apprehend will deny he is superior to r obert artin hoever might be her parents said r nightley whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society fter receiving a very indifferent education she is left in rs oddard s hands to shift as she can to move in short in rs oddard s line to have rs oddard s acquaintance er friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough he desired nothing better herself ill you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it he was as happy as possible with the artins in the summer he had no sense of superiority then f she has it now you have given it ou have been no friend to arriet mith mma obert artin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him know him well e has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion nd as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man know epend upon it he had encouragement t was most convenient to mma not to make a direct reply to this assertion she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again ou are a very warm friend to r artin but as said before are unjust to arriet arriet s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them he is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly aiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as arriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice er good nature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess pon my word mma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too etter be without sense than misapply it as you do o be sure cried she playfully know that is the feeling of you all know that such a girl as arriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment h arriet may pick and chuse ere you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you nd is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives o pray let her have time to look about her have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said r nightley presently though have kept my thoughts to myself but now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for arriet ou will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her anity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief othing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high iss arriet mith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl en of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives en of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed et her marry obert artin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlour boarder at rs oddard s all the rest of her life or at least for arriet mith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son e think so very differently on this point r nightley that there can be no use in canvassing it e shall only be making each other more angry ut as to my letting her marry obert artin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly think as must prevent any second application he must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself will not pretend to say that might not influence her a little but assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do is appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him e was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at bbey ill find him disagreeable ut the case is altered now he knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with arriet onsense errant nonsense as ever was talked cried r nightley obert artin s manners have sense sincerity and good humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than arriet mith could understand mma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone he did not repent what she had done she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state was very disagreeable ome minutes passed in this unpleasant silence with only one attempt on mma s side to talk of the weather but he made no answer e was thinking he result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words obert artin has no great loss if he can but think so and hope it will not be long before he does our views for arriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have and as a friend shall just hint to you that if lton is the man think it will be all labour in vain mma laughed and disclaimed e continued epend upon it lton will not do lton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of ighbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match e knows the value of a good income as well as any body lton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally e is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with arriet s e knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece am very much obliged to you said mma laughing again f had set my heart on r lton s marrying arriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present only want to keep arriet to myself have done with match making indeed could never hope to equal my own doings at andalls shall leave off while am well ood morning to you said he rising and walking off abruptly e was very much vexed e felt the disappointment of the young man and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded mma had taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly mma remained in a state of vexation too but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her s than in his he did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary s wrong as r nightley e walked off in more complete self approbation than he left for her he was not so materially cast down however but that a little time and the return of arriet were very adequate restoratives arriet s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy he possibility of the young man s coming to rs oddard s that morning and meeting with arriet and pleading his own cause gave alarming ideas he dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness and when arriet appeared and in very good spirits and without having any such reason to give for her long absence she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind and convinced her that let r nightley think or say what he would she had done nothing which woman s friendship and woman s feelings would not justify e had frightened her a little about r lton but when she considered that r nightley could not have observed him as she had done neither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself in spite of r nightley s pretensions with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it hastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew any thing about e certainly might have heard r lton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done and r lton might not be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them but then r nightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives r nightley saw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its effects but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest and more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very sure did not belong to r lton arriet s cheerful look and manner established hers she came back not to think of r artin but to talk of r lton iss ash had been telling her something which she repeated immediately with great delight r erry had been to rs oddard s to attend a sick child and iss ash had seen him and he had told iss ash that as he was coming back yesterday from layton ark he had met r lton and found to his great surprize that r lton was actually on his road to ondon and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the whist club night which he had been never known to miss before and r erry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day but it would not do r lton had been determined to go on and had said in a very particular way indeed that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious r erry could not quite understand him but he was very sure there must be a lady in the case and he told him so and r lton only looked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits iss ash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more about r lton and said looking so very significantly at her that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only knew that any woman whom r lton could prefer she should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt r lton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness r nightley might quarrel with her but mma could not quarrel with herself e was so much displeased that it was longer than usual before he came to artfield again and when they did meet his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven he was sorry but could not repent n the contrary her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days he icture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after r lton s return and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting room he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought and as for arriet s feelings they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted mma was soon perfectly satisfied of r artin s being no otherwise remembered than as he furnished a contrast with r lton of the utmost advantage to the latter er views of improving her little friend s mind by a great deal of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than a few first chapters and the intention of going on to morrow t was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at arriet s fortune than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts and the only literary pursuit which engaged arriet at present the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hot pressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies n this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon iss ash head teacher at rs oddard s had written out at least three hundred and arriet who had taken the first hint of it from her hoped with iss oodhouse s help to get a great many more mma assisted with her invention memory and taste and as arriet wrote a very pretty hand it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form as well as quantity r oodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in o many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young he wondered he could not remember them but he hoped he should in time nd it always ended in itty a fair but frozen maid is good friend erry too whom he had spoken to on the subject did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind but he had desired erry to be upon the watch and as he went about so much something he thought might come from that quarter t was by no means his daughter s wish that the intellects of ighbury in general should be put under requisition r lton was the only one whose assistance she asked e was invited to contribute any really good enigmas charades or conundrums that he might recollect and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections and at the same time as she could perceive most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips hey owed to him their two or three politest puzzles and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled and rather sentimentally recited that well known charade y first doth affliction denote hich my second is destin d to feel nd my whole is the best antidote hat affliction to soften and heal made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already hy will not you write one yourself for us r lton said she that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be easier to you h no he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind in his life he stupidest fellow e was afraid not even iss oodhouse he stopt a moment or iss mith could inspire him he very next day however produced some proof of inspiration e called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which from his manner mma was immediately convinced must be his own do not offer it for iss mith s collection said he eing my friend s have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it he speech was more to mma than to arriet which mma could understand here was deep consciousness about him and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend s e was gone the next moment after another moment s pause ake it said mma smiling and pushing the paper towards arriet it is for you ake your own ut arriet was in a tremor and could not touch it and mma never loth to be first was obliged to examine it herself o iss y first displays the wealth and pomp of kings ords of the earth

to break off from these very pleasant observations which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the eagerness of arriet s wondering questions hat can it be iss oodhouse what can it be

dear arriet you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending ead it in comfort to yourself here can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you arriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion he read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness he could not speak ut she was not wanted to speak t was enough for her to feel mma spoke for her here is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment said she that cannot have a doubt as to r lton s intentions ou are his object and you will soon receive the completest proof of it thought it must be so thought could not be so deceived but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided as my wishes on the subject have been ever since knew you es arriet just so long have been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened could never tell whether an attachment between you and r lton were most desirable or most natural ts probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other am very happy congratulate you my dear arriet with all my heart his is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating his is a connexion which offers nothing but good t will give you every thing that you want consideration independence a proper home it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to artfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever his arriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us ear iss oodhouse and ear iss oodhouse was all that arriet with many tender embraces could articulate at first but when they did arrive at something more like conversation it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw felt anticipated and remembered just as she ought r lton s superiority had very ample acknowledgment hatever you say is always right cried arriet and therefore suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise could not have imagined it t is so much beyond any thing deserve r lton who might

question about that t is a certainty eceive it on my judgment t is a sort of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon followed by matter of fact prose t is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected am sure a month ago had no more idea myself he strangest things do take place hen iss miths and r ltons get acquainted they do indeed and really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirable what courts the pre arrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form ou and r lton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes our marrying will be equal to the match at andalls here does seem to be a something in the air of artfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow he course of true love never did run smooth artfield edition of hakespeare would have a long note on that passage hat r lton should really be in love with me me of all people who did not know him to speak to him at ichaelmas nd he the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to quite like r nightley is company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week nd so excellent in the hurch iss ash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to ighbury ear me hen look back to the first time saw him ow little did think he two bbots and ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and iss ash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good natured nd how beautiful we thought he looked e was arm in arm with r ole his is an alliance which whoever whatever your friends may be must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools f they are anxious to see you happily married here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be well married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them es very true ow nicely you talk love to hear you ou understand every thing ou and r lton are one as clever as the other his charade f had studied a twelvemonth could never have made any thing like it thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday do think it is without exception the best charade ever read never read one more to the purpose certainly t is as long again as almost all we have had before do not consider its length as particularly in its favour uch things in general cannot be too short arriet was too intent on the lines to hear he most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind t is one thing said she presently her cheeks in a glow to have very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you must in a short way and another to write verses and charades like this mma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of r artin s prose uch sweet lines continued arriet these two last ut how shall ever be able to return the paper or say have found it out h iss oodhouse what can we do about that eave it to me ou do nothing e will be here this evening dare say and then will give it him back and some nonsense or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed our soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming rust to me h iss oodhouse what a pity that must not write this beautiful charade into my book am sure have not got one half so good eave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book h but those two lines are he best of all ranted for private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them hey are not at all the less written you know because you divide them he couplet does not cease to be nor does its meaning change ut take it away and all appropriation ceases and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection epend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his passion poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither ive me the book will write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you arriet submitted though her mind could hardly separate the parts so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love t seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity shall never let that book go out of my own hands said she ery well replied mma a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better shall be pleased ut here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him t will be giving him so much pleasure e loves any thing of the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment e has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all ou must let me read it to him arriet looked grave y dear arriet you must not refine too much upon this charade ou will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it o not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration f he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper while was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you o not let us be too solemn on the business e has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade h no hope shall not be ridiculous about it o as you please r oodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of ell my dears how does your book go on ave you got any thing fresh es papa we have something to read you something quite fresh piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in he read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read slowly and distinctly and two or three times over with explanations of every part as she proceeded and he was very much pleased and as she had foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion ye that s very just indeed that s very properly said ery true oman lovely woman t is such a pretty charade my dear that can easily guess what fairy brought it obody could have written so prettily but you mma mma only nodded and smiled fter a little thinking and a very tender sigh he added h it is no difficulty to see who you take after our dear mother was so clever at all those things f had but her memory ut can remember nothing not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention can only recollect the first stanza and there are several itty a fair but frozen maid indled a flame yet deplore he hood wink d boy called to aid hough of his near approach afraid o fatal to my suit before nd that is all that can recollect of it but it is very clever all the way through ut think my dear you said you had got it es papa it is written out in our second page e copied it from the legant xtracts t was arrick s you know ye very true wish could recollect more of it itty a fair but frozen maid he name makes me think of poor sabella for she was very near being christened atherine after her grandmama hope we shall have her here next week ave you thought my dear where you shall put her and what room there will be for the children h yes she will have her own room of course the room she always has and there is the nursery for the children just as usual you know hy should there be any change do not know my dear but it is so long since she was here not since last aster and then only for a few days r ohn nightley s being a lawyer is very inconvenient oor sabella she is sadly taken away from us all and how sorry she will be when she comes not to see iss aylor here he will not be surprized papa at least do not know my dear am sure was very much surprized when first heard she was going to be married e must ask r and rs eston to dine with us while sabella is here es my dear if there is time ut in a very depressed tone she is coming for only one week here will not be time for any thing t is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer but it seems a case of necessity r ohn nightley must be in town again on the th and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country that two or three days are not to be taken out for the bbey r nightley promises to give up his claim this hristmas though you know it is longer since they were with him than with us t would be very hard indeed my dear if poor sabella were to be anywhere but at artfield r oodhouse could never allow for r nightley s claims on his brother or any body s claims on sabella except his own e sat musing a little while and then said ut do not see why poor sabella should be obliged to go back so soon though he does think mma shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us he and the children might stay very well h papa that is what you never have been able to accomplish and do not think you ever will sabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband his was too true for contradiction nwelcome as it was r oodhouse could only give a submissive sigh and as mma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter s attachment to her husband she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them arriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here am sure she will be pleased with the children e are very proud of the children are not we papa wonder which she will think the handsomest enry or ohn ye wonder which she will oor little dears how glad they will be to come hey are very fond of being at artfield arriet dare say they are sir am sure do not know who is not enry is a fine boy but ohn is very like his mama enry is the eldest he was named after me not after his father ohn the second is named after his father ome people are surprized believe that the eldest was not but sabella would have him called enry which thought very pretty of her nd he is a very clever boy indeed hey are all remarkably clever and they have so many pretty ways hey will come and stand by my chair and say randpapa can you give me a bit of string and once enry asked me for a knife but told him knives were only made for grandpapas think their father is too rough with them very often e appears rough to you said mma because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough e wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate father certainly r ohn nightley is an affectionate father he children are all fond of him nd then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way ut they like it papa there is nothing they like so much t is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other ell cannot understand it hat is the case with us all papa ne half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other ater in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o clock dinner the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again arriet turned away but mma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push of having thrown a die and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up is ostensible reason however was to ask whether r oodhouse s party could be made up in the evening without him or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at artfield f he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend ole had been saying so much about his dining with him had made such a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come mma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account her father was sure of his rubber e re urged she re declined and he seemed then about to make his bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it h here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it e admired it so much that have ventured to write it into iss mith s collection our friend will not take it amiss hope f course have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines r lton certainly did not very well know what to say e looked rather doubtingly rather confused said something about honour glanced at mma and at arriet and then seeing the book open on the table took it up and examined it very attentively ith the view of passing off an awkward moment mma smilingly said ou must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two e may be sure of every woman s approbation while he writes with such gallantry have no hesitation in saying replied r lton though hesitating a good deal while he spoke have no hesitation in saying at least if my friend feels at all as do have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as see it looking at the book again and replacing it on the table he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life fter this speech he was gone as soon as possible mma could not think it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh he ran away to indulge the inclination leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to arriet s share hough now the middle of ecember there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise and on the morrow mma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family who lived a little way out of ighbury heir road to this detached cottage was down icarage ane a lane leading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street of the place and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode of r lton few inferior dwellings were first to be passed and then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the icarage an old and not very good house almost as close to the road as it could be t had no advantage of situation but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes mma s remark was here it is here go you and your riddle book one of these days arriet s was h what a sweet house ow very beautiful here are the yellow curtains that iss ash admires so much do not often walk this way now said mma as they proceeded but then there will be an inducement and shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of ighbury arriet she found had never in her life been within side the icarage and her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors and probabilities mma could only class it as a proof of love with r lton s seeing ready wit in her wish we could contrive it said she but cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in no servant that want to inquire about of his housekeeper no message from my father he pondered but could think of nothing fter a mutual silence of some minutes arriet thus began again do so wonder iss oodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married so charming as you are mma laughed and replied y being charming arriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry must find other people charming one other person at least nd am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all h so you say but cannot believe it must see somebody very superior to any one have seen yet to be tempted r lton you know recollecting herself is out of the question and do not wish to see any such person would rather not be tempted cannot really change for the better f were to marry must expect to repent it ear me it is so odd to hear a woman talk so have none of the usual inducements of women to marry ere to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing but never have been in love it is not my way or my nature and do not think ever shall nd without love am sure should be a fool to change such a situation as mine ortune do not want employment do not want consequence do not want believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband s house as am of artfield and never never could expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any man s eyes as am in my father s ut then to be an old maid at last like iss ates hat is as formidable an image as you could present arriet and if thought should ever be like iss ates so silly so satisfied so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing and unfastidious and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me would marry to morrow ut between us am convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried ut still you will be an old maid and that s so dreadful ever mind arriet shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else nd the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper hose who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross his does not apply however to iss ates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor overty certainly has not contracted her mind really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm ear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself when you grow old f know myself arriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and do not perceive why should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty oman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation f draw less shall read more if give up music shall take to carpet work nd as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying shall be very well off with all the children of a sister love so much to care about here will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need here will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder y nephews and nieces shall often have a niece with me o you know iss ates s niece hat is know you must have seen her a hundred times but are you acquainted h yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to ighbury y the bye that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece eaven forbid at least that should ever bore people half so much about all the nightleys together as she does about ane airfax ne is sick of the very name of ane airfax very letter from her is read forty times over her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month wish ane airfax very well but she tires me to death hey were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics were superseded mma was very compassionate and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness her counsel and her patience as from her purse he understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and their temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into their troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good will n the present instance it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to arriet as they walked away hese are the sights arriet to do one good ow trifling they make every thing else appear feel now as if could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind ery true said arriet oor creatures one can think of nothing else nd really do not think the impression will soon be over said mma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep which ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden and brought them into the lane again do not think it will stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place and recall the still greater within h dear no said her companion hey walked on he lane made a slight bend and when that bend was passed r lton was immediately in sight and so near as to give mma time only to say farther h arriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts ell smiling hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important f we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves arriet could just answer h dear yes before the gentleman joined them he wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the first subject on meeting e had been going to call on them is visit he would now defer but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done r lton then turned back to accompany them o fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought mma to meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase of love on each side should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration t must if were not here wish were anywhere else nxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised on one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road ut she had not been there two minutes when she found that arriet s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that in short they would both be soon after her his would not do she immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half boot and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on and she would follow in half a minute hey did as they were desired and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot she had the comfort of farther delay in her power being overtaken by a child from the cottage setting out according to orders with her pitcher to fetch broth from artfield o walk by the side of this child and talk to and question her was the most natural thing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been acting just then without design and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her he gained on them however involuntarily the child s pace was quick and theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them r lton was speaking with animation arriet listening with a very pleased attention and mma having sent the child on was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more when they both looked around and she was obliged to join them r lton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail and mma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday s party at his friend ole s and that she was come in herself for the tilton cheese the north iltshire the butter the cellery the beet root and all the dessert his would soon have led to something better of course was her consoling reflection any thing interests between those who love and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart f could but have kept longer away hey now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage pales when a sudden resolution of at least getting arriet into the house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot and fall behind to arrange it once more he then broke the lace off short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently obliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort art of my lace is gone said she and do not know how am to contrive really am a most troublesome companion to you both but hope am not often so ill equipped r lton must beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on r lton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage he room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied and looking forwards behind it was another with which it immediately communicated the door between them was open and mma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner he was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it but she fully intended that r lton should close it t was not closed however it still remained ajar but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room or ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself t could be protracted no longer he was then obliged to be finished and make her appearance he lovers were standing together at one of the windows t had a most favourable aspect and for half a minute mma felt the glory of having schemed successfully ut it would not do he had not come to the point e had been most agreeable most delightful he had told arriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely followed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt but nothing serious autious very cautious thought mma he advances inch by inch and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure till however though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both and must be leading them forward to the great event r lton must now be left to himself t was no longer in mma s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures he coming of her sister s family was so very near at hand that first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth her prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay at artfield it was not to be expected she did not herself expect that any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers hey might advance rapidly if they would however they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no he hardly wished to have more leisure for them here are people who the more you do for them the less they will do for themselves r and rs ohn nightley from having been longer than usual absent from urry were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest ill this year every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between artfield and onwell bbey but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea bathing for the children and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their urry connexions or seen at all by r oodhouse who could not be induced to get so far as ondon even for poor sabella s sake and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit e thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way but his alarms were needless the sixteen miles being happily accomplished and r and rs ohn nightley their five children and a competent number of nursery maids all reaching artfield in safety he bustle and joy of such an arrival the many to be talked to welcomed encouraged and variously dispersed and disposed of produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause nor have endured much longer even for this but the ways of artfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by rs ohn nightley that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance all the eating and drinking and sleeping and playing which they could possibly wish for without the smallest delay the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them rs ohn nightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle quiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate wrapt up in her family a devoted wife a doating mother and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for these higher ties a warmer love might have seemed impossible he could never see a fault in any of them he was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness and with this resemblance of her father she inherited also much of his constitution was delicate in her own health over careful of that of her children had many fears and many nerves and was as fond of her own r ingfield in town as her father could be of r erry hey were alike too in a general benevolence of temper and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance r ohn nightley was a tall gentleman like and very clever man rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his private character but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour e was not an ill tempered man not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach but his temper was not his great perfection and indeed with such a worshipping wife it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased he extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his e had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted and he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing e was not a great favourite with his fair sister in law othing wrong in him escaped her he was quick in feeling the little injuries to sabella which sabella never felt herself erhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to sabella s sister but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend without praise and without blindness but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into the want of respectful forbearance towards her father here he had not always the patience that could have been wished r oodhouse s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill bestowed t did not often happen for r ohn nightley had really a great regard for his father in law and generally a strong sense of what was due to him but it was too often for mma s charity especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured though the offence came not he beginning however of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality hey had not been long seated and composed when r oodhouse with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughter s attention to the sad change at artfield since she had been there last h my dear said he poor iss aylor t is a grievous business h yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must miss her nd dear mma too hat a dreadful loss to you both have been so grieved for you could not imagine how you could possibly do without her t is a sad change indeed ut hope she is pretty well sir retty well my dear hope pretty well do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably r ohn nightley here asked mma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of andalls h no none in the least never saw rs eston better in my life never looking so well apa is only speaking his own regret ery much to the honour of both was the handsome reply nd do you see her sir tolerably often asked sabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father r oodhouse hesitated ot near so often my dear as could wish h papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married ither in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either r eston or rs eston and generally both either at andalls or here and as you may suppose sabella most frequently here hey are very very kind in their visits r eston is really as kind as herself apa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving sabella a false idea of us all very body must be aware that iss aylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that r and rs eston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth ust as it should be said r ohn nightley and just as hoped it was from your letters er wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy have been always telling you my love that had no idea of the change being so very material to artfield as you apprehended and now you have mma s account hope you will be satisfied hy to be sure said r oodhouse yes certainly cannot deny that rs eston poor rs eston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again t would be very hard upon r eston if she did not papa ou quite forget poor r eston think indeed said ohn nightley pleasantly that r eston has some little claim ou and mma will venture to take the part of the poor husband being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force s for sabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the r estons aside as much as she can e my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part re you talking about me am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving artfield should never have thought of iss aylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting r eston that excellent r eston think there is nothing he does not deserve believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed xcepting yourself and your brother do not know his equal for temper shall never forget his flying enry s kite for him that very windy day last aster and ever since his particular kindness last eptember twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at obham have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence f any body can deserve him it must be iss aylor here is the young man said ohn nightley as he been here on this occasion or has he not e has not been here yet replied mma here was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and have not heard him mentioned lately ut you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father e wrote a letter to poor rs eston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was he shewed it to me thought it very well done of him indeed hether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell e is but young and his uncle perhaps y dear papa he is three and twenty ou forget how time passes hree and twenty is he indeed ell could not have thought it and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother ell time does fly indeed and my memory is very bad owever it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave r and rs eston a great deal of pleasure remember it was written from eymouth and dated ept th and began y dear adam but forget how it went on and it was signed eston hurchill remember that perfectly ow very pleasing and proper of him cried the good hearted rs ohn nightley have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man ut how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father here is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home never could comprehend how r eston could part with him o give up one s child really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else obody ever did think well of the hurchills fancy observed r ohn nightley coolly ut you need not imagine r eston to have felt what you would feel in giving up enry or ohn r eston is rather an easy cheerful tempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords mma could not like what bordered on a reflection on r eston and had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let it pass he would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the all sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brother s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important t had a high claim to forbearance r nightley was to dine with them rather against the inclination of r oodhouse who did not like that any one should share with him in sabella s first day mma s sense of right however had decided it and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother she had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late disagreement between r nightley and herself in procuring him the proper invitation he hoped they might now become friends again he thought it was time to make up aking up indeed would not do he certainly had not been in the wrong and he would never own that he had oncession must be out of the question but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her the youngest a nice little girl about eight months old who was now making her first visit to artfield and very happy to be danced about in her aunt s arms t did assist for though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity mma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the baby hat a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces s to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children observe we never disagree f you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike o be sure our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong es said he smiling and reason good was sixteen years old when you were born material difference then she replied and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer es a good deal nearer ut still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we think differently have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child ome my dear mma let us be friends and say no more about it ell your aunt little mma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now hat s true she cried very true ittle mma grow up a better woman than your aunt e infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited ow r nightley a word or two more and have done s far as good intentions went we were both right and must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong only want to know that r artin is not very very bitterly disappointed man cannot be more so was his short full answer h ndeed am very sorry ome shake hands with me his had just taken place and with great cordiality when ohn nightley made his appearance and ow d ye do eorge and ohn how are you succeeded in the true nglish style burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference the real attachment which would have led either of them if requisite to do every thing for the good of the other he evening was quiet and conversable as r oodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear sabella and the little party made two natural divisions on one side he and his daughter on the other the two r nightleys their subjects totally distinct or very rarely mixing and mma only occasionally joining in one or the other he brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally of those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative and who was always the greater talker s a magistrate he had generally some point of law to consult ohn about or at least some curious anecdote to give and as a farmer as keeping in hand the home farm at onwell he had to tell what every field was to bear next year and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life and whose attachments were strong he plan of a drain the change of a fence the felling of a tree and the destination of every acre for wheat turnips or spring corn was entered into with as much equality of interest by ohn as his cooler manners rendered possible and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness hile they were thus comfortably occupied r oodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter y poor dear sabella said he fondly taking her hand and interrupting for a few moments her busy labours for some one of her five children ow long it is how terribly long since you were here nd how tired you must be after your journey ou must go to bed early my dear and recommend a little gruel to you before you go ou and will have a nice basin of gruel together y dear mma suppose we all have a little gruel mma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did that both the r nightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself and two basins only were ordered fter a little more discourse in praise of gruel with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body he proceeded to say with an air of grave reflection t was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn at outh nd instead of coming here never had much opinion of the sea air r ingfield most strenuously recommended it sir or we should not have gone e recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little ella s throat both sea air and bathing h my dear but erry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body am sure it almost killed me once ome come cried mma feeling this to be an unsafe subject must beg you not to talk of the sea t makes me envious and miserable who have never seen it outh nd is prohibited if you please y dear sabella have not heard you make one inquiry about r erry yet and he never forgets you h good r erry how is he sir hy pretty well but not quite well oor erry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has not time to take care of himself which is very sad but he is always wanted all round the country suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere ut then there is not so clever a man any where nd rs erry and the children how are they do the children grow have a great regard for r erry hope he will be calling soon e will be so pleased to see my little ones hope he will be here to morrow for have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence nd my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little ella s throat h my dear sir her throat is so much better that have hardly any uneasiness about it ither bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of r ingfield s which we have been applying at times ever since ugust t is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her and if had known you were wanting an embrocation would have spoken to ou seem to me to have forgotten rs and iss ates said mma have not heard one inquiry after them h the good ateses am quite ashamed of myself but you mention them in most of your letters hope they are quite well ood old rs ates will call upon her to morrow and take my children hey are always so pleased to see my children nd that excellent iss ates such thorough worthy people ow are they sir hy pretty well my dear upon the whole ut poor rs ates had a bad cold about a month ago ow sorry am ut colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn r ingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy except when it has been quite an influenza hat has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree you mention erry says that colds have been very general but not so heavy as he has very often known them in ovember erry does not call it altogether a sickly season o do not know that r ingfield considers it very sickly except h my poor dear child the truth is that in ondon it is always a sickly season obody is healthy in ondon nobody can be t is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off and the air so bad o indeed we are not at all in a bad air ur part of ondon is very superior to most others ou must not confound us with ondon in general my dear sir he neighbourhood of runswick quare is very different from almost all the rest e are so very airy should be unwilling own to live in any other part of the town there is hardly any other that could be satisfied to have my children in but we are so remarkably airy r ingfield thinks the vicinity of runswick quare decidedly the most favourable as to air h my dear it is not like artfield ou make the best of it but after you have been a week at artfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same ow cannot say that think you are any of you looking well at present am sorry to hear you say so sir but assure you excepting those little nervous head aches and palpitations which am never entirely free from anywhere am quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming hope you will think better of their looks to morrow for assure you r ingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case trust at least that you do not think r nightley looking ill turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband iddling my dear cannot compliment you think r ohn nightley very far from looking well hat is the matter sir id you speak to me cried r ohn nightley hearing his own name am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but hope it is only from being a little fatigued could have wished however as you know that you had seen r ingfield before you left home y dear sabella exclaimed he hastily pray do not concern yourself about my looks e satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look as chuse did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother cried mma about your friend r raham s intending to have a bailiff from cotland to look after his new estate hat will it answer ill not the old prejudice be too strong nd she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing worse to hear than sabella s kind inquiry after ane airfax and ane airfax though no great favourite with her in general she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising hat sweet amiable ane airfax said rs ohn nightley t is so long since have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town hat happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them always regret excessively on dear mma s account that she cannot be more at ighbury but now their daughter is married suppose olonel and rs ampbell will not be able to part with her at all he would be such a delightful companion for mma r oodhouse agreed to it all but added ur little friend arriet mith however is just such another pretty kind of young person ou will like arriet mma could not have a better companion than arriet am most happy to hear it but only ane airfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior and exactly mma s age his topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of similar moment and passed away with similar harmony but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation he gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said much praise and many comments undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty severe hilippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable but unfortunately among the failures which the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore most prominent was in her own cook at outh nd a young woman hired for the time who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin ften as she had wished for and ordered it she had never been able to get any thing tolerable ere was a dangerous opening h said r oodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern he ejaculation in mma s ear expressed h there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to outh nd t does not bear talking of nd for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel fter an interval of some minutes however he began with shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here ut why should you be sorry sir assure you it did the children a great deal of good nd moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to outh nd outh nd is an unhealthy place erry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon outh nd know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite a mistake sir e all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and r ingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy and am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly ou should have gone to romer my dear if you went anywhere erry was a week at romer once and he holds it to be the best of all the sea bathing places fine open sea he says and very pure air nd by what understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea a quarter of a mile off very comfortable ou should have consulted erry ut my dear sir the difference of the journey only consider how great it would have been n hundred miles perhaps instead of forty h my dear as erry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred etter not move at all better stay in ondon altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air his is just what erry said t seemed to him a very ill judged measure mma s attempts to stop her father had been vain and when he had reached such a point as this she could not wonder at her brother in law s breaking out r erry said he in a voice of very strong displeasure would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for hy does he make it any business of his to wonder at what do at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another may be allowed hope the use of my judgment as well as r erry want his directions no more than his drugs e paused and growing cooler in a moment added with only sarcastic dryness f r erry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty should be as willing to prefer romer to outh nd as he could himself rue true cried r nightley with most ready interposition very true hat s a consideration indeed ut ohn as to what was telling you of my idea of moving the path to angham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows cannot conceive any difficulty should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the ighbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path he only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps shall see you at the bbey to morrow morning hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion r oodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend erry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil and the immediate alertness of one brother and better recollections of the other prevented any renewal of it here could hardly be a happier creature in the world than rs ohn nightley in this short visit to artfield going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister he had nothing to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass so swiftly t was a delightful visit perfect in being much too short n general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too there was no avoiding though at hristmas r eston would take no denial they must all dine at andalls one day even r oodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party ow they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty if he could but as his son and daughter s carriage and horses were actually at artfield he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head it hardly amounted to a doubt nor did it occupy mma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for arriet also arriet r lton and r nightley their own especial set were the only persons invited to meet them the hours were to be early as well as the numbers few r oodhouse s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing he evening before this great event for it was a very great event that r oodhouse should dine out on the th of ecember had been spent by arriet at artfield and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by rs oddard mma could not have allowed her to leave the house mma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed with regard to andalls he was very feverish and had a bad sore throat rs oddard was full of care and affection r erry was talked of and arriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement though she could not speak of her loss without many tears mma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in rs oddard s unavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much r lton s would be depressed when he knew her state and left her at last tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much he had not advanced many yards from rs oddard s door when she was met by r lton himself evidently coming towards it and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid of whom he on the rumour of considerable illness had been going to inquire that he might carry some report of her to artfield they were overtaken by r ohn nightley returning from the daily visit to onwell with his two eldest boys whose healthy glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for hey joined company and proceeded together mma was just describing the nature of her friend s complaint a throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat about her a quick low pulse c and she was sorry to find from rs oddard that arriet was liable to very bad sore throats and had often alarmed her with them r lton looked all alarm on the occasion as he exclaimed sore throat hope not infectious hope not of a putrid infectious sort as erry seen her ndeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend et me entreat you to run no risks hy does not erry see her mma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of rs oddard s experience and care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist than not she added soon afterwards as if quite another subject t is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself do not like to interfere as know it would be so great a disappointment to r and rs eston ut upon my word r lton in your case should certainly excuse myself ou appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to night r lton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make which was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of her s he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit but mma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being very cold certainly very cold and walked on rejoicing in having extricated him from andalls and secured him the power of sending to inquire after arriet every hour of the evening ou do quite right said she we will make your apologies to r and rs eston ut hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage if the weather were r lton s only objection and r lton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction t was a done thing r lton was to go and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her ell said she to herself this is most strange fter had got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave arriet ill behind ost strange indeed ut there is believe in many men especially single men such an inclination such a passion for dining out a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities almost their duties that any thing gives way to it and this must be the case with r lton a most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love with arriet but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked hat a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in arriet but will not dine alone for her oon afterwards r lton quitted them and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming arriet at parting in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at rs oddard s for news of her fair friend the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again when he hoped to be able to give a better report and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour fter a few minutes of entire silence between them ohn nightley began with never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than r lton t is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned ith men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works r lton s manners are not perfect replied mma but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal here a man does his best with only moderate powers he will have the advantage over negligent superiority here is such perfect good temper and good will in r lton as one cannot but value es said r ohn nightley presently with some slyness he seems to have a great deal of good will towards you e she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining me to be r lton s object uch an imagination has crossed me own mma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now r lton in love with me hat an idea do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly think your manners to him encouraging speak as a friend mma ou had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do thank you but assure you you are quite mistaken r lton and are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in want of counsel e said no more r oodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit that in spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others too full of the wonder of his own going and the pleasure it was to afford at andalls to see that it was cold and too well wrapt up to feel it he cold however was severe and by the time the second carriage was in motion a few flakes of snow were finding their way down and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time mma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour he preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice of his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least which r ohn nightley did not by any means like he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent man said he must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as this for the sake of coming to see him e must think himself a most agreeable fellow could not do such a thing t is the greatest absurdity ctually snowing at this moment he folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home and the folly of people s not staying comfortably at home when they can f we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of duty or business what a hardship we should deem it and here are we probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man s house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again to morrow oing in dismal weather to return probably in worse four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home mma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving to emulate the ery true my love which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all he could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome her heroism reached only to silence he allowed him to talk and arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening her lips hey arrived the carriage turned the step was let down and r lton spruce black and smiling was with them instantly mma thought with pleasure of some change of subject r lton was all obligation and cheerfulness he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed that she began to think he must have received a different account of arriet from what had reached her he had sent while dressing and the answer had been uch the same not better y report from rs oddard s said she presently was not so pleasant as had hoped ot better was my answer is face lengthened immediately and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered h no am grieved to find was on the point of telling you that when called at rs oddard s door which did the very last thing before returned to dress was told that iss mith was not better by no means better rather worse ery much grieved and concerned had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as knew had been given her in the morning mma smiled and answered y visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint hope but not even can charm away a sore throat it is a most severe cold indeed r erry has been with her as you probably heard es imagined that is did not e has been used to her in these complaints and hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report ut it is impossible not to feel uneasiness uch a sad loss to our party to day readful xactly so indeed he will be missed every moment his was very proper the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable but it should have lasted longer mma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment hat an excellent device said he the use of a sheepskin for carriages ow very comfortable they make it impossible to feel cold with such precautions he contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman s carriage perfectly complete ne is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted eather becomes absolutely of no consequence t is a very cold afternoon but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter a snows a little see es said ohn nightley and think we shall have a good deal of it hristmas weather observed r lton uite seasonable and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday and prevent this day s party which it might very possibly have done for r oodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence his is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings t hristmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather was snowed up at a friend s house once for a week othing could be pleasanter went for only one night and could not get away till that very day se nnight r ohn nightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure but said only coolly cannot wish to be snowed up a week at andalls t another time mma might have been amused but she was too much astonished now at r lton s spirits for other feelings arriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party e are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing in the greatest comfort harming people r and rs eston rs eston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so hospitable and so fond of society it will be a small party but where small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any r eston s dining room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my part would rather under such circumstances fall short by two than exceed by two think you will agree with me turning with a soft air to mma think shall certainly have your approbation though r nightley perhaps from being used to the large parties of ondon may not quite enter into our feelings know nothing of the large parties of ondon sir never dine with any body ndeed in a tone of wonder and pity had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery ell sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment y first enjoyment replied ohn nightley as they passed through the sweep gate will be to find myself safe at artfield again ome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into rs eston s drawing room r lton must compose his joyous looks and r ohn nightley disperse his ill humour r lton must smile less and r ohn nightley more to fit them for the place mma only might be as nature prompted and shew herself just as happy as she was o her it was real enjoyment to be with the estons r eston was a great favourite and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve as to his wife not any one to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood of being always interesting and always intelligible the little affairs arrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father and herself he could tell nothing of artfield in which rs eston had not a lively concern and half an hour s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends was one of the first gratifications of each his was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day s visit might not afford which certainly did not belong to the present half hour but the very sight of rs eston her smile her touch her voice was grateful to mma and she determined to think as little as possible of r lton s oddities or of any thing else unpleasant and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost he misfortune of arriet s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival r oodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it besides all the history of his own and sabella s coming and of mma s being to follow and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that ames should come and see his daughter when the others appeared and rs eston who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him was able to turn away and welcome her dear mma mma s project of forgetting r lton for a while made her rather sorry to find when they had all taken their places that he was close to her he difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards arriet from her mind while he not only sat at her elbow but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion nstead of forgetting him his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of an it really be as my brother imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from arriet to me bsurd and insufferable et he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm would be so interested about her father and so delighted with rs eston and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would be lover and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners or her own sake she could not be rude and for arriet s in the hope that all would yet turn out right she was even positively civil but it was an effort especially as something was going on amongst the others in the most overpowering period of r lton s nonsense which she particularly wished to listen to he heard enough to know that r eston was giving some information about his son she heard the words my son and rank and my son repeated several times over and from a few other half syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son but before she could quiet r lton the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward ow it so happened that in spite of mma s resolution of never marrying there was something in the name in the idea of r rank hurchill which always interested her he had frequently thought especially since his father s marriage with iss aylor that if she were to marry he was the very person to suit her in age character and condition e seemed by this connexion between the families quite to belong to her he could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of hat r and rs eston did think of it she was very strongly persuaded and though not meaning to be induced by him or by any body else to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for she had a great curiosity to see him a decided intention of finding him pleasant of being liked by him to a certain degree and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends imaginations ith such sensations r lton s civilities were dreadfully ill timed but she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling very cross and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again or the substance of it from the open hearted r eston o it proved for when happily released from r lton and seated by r eston at dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton to say to her e want only two more to be just the right number should like to see two more here your pretty little friend iss mith and my son and then should say we were quite complete believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing room that we are expecting rank had a letter from him this morning and he will be with us within a fortnight mma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure and fully assented to his proposition of r rank hurchill and iss mith making their party quite complete e has been wanting to come to us continued r eston ever since eptember every letter has been full of it but he cannot command his own time e has those to please who must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices ut now have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in anuary hat a very great pleasure it will be to you and rs eston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself es she would be but that she thinks there will be another put off he does not depend upon his coming so much as do but she does not know the parties so well as do he case you see is but this is quite between ourselves did not mention a syllable of it in the other room here are secrets in all families you know he case is that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at nscombe in anuary and that rank s coming depends upon their being put off f they are not put off he cannot stir ut know they will because it is a family that a certain lady of some consequence at nscombe has a particular dislike to and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point have not the smallest doubt of the issue am as confident of seeing rank here before the middle of anuary as am of being here myself but your good friend there nodding towards the upper end of the table has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at artfield that she cannot calculate on their effects as have been long in the practice of doing am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case replied mma but am disposed to side with you r eston f you think he will come shall think so too for you know nscombe es have some right to that knowledge though have never been at the place in my life he is an odd woman ut never allow myself to speak ill of her on rank s account for do believe her to be very fond of him used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her way allowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes nd it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper mma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to rs eston very soon after their moving into the drawing room wishing her joy yet observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming rs eston agreed to it but added that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of for cannot depend upon his coming cannot be so sanguine as r eston am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing r eston dare say has been telling you exactly how the matter stands es it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of rs hurchill which imagine to be the most certain thing in the world y mma replied rs eston smiling what is the certainty of caprice hen turning to sabella who had not been attending before ou must know my dear rs nightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing r rank hurchill in my opinion as his father thinks t depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper o you to my two daughters may venture on the truth rs hurchill rules at nscombe and is a very odd tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him h rs hurchill every body knows rs hurchill replied sabella and am sure never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion o be constantly living with an ill tempered person must be dreadful t is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery hat a blessing that she never had any children oor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them mma wished she had been alone with rs eston he should then have heard more rs eston would speak to her with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with sabella and she really believed would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the hurchills from her excepting those views on the young man of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge ut at present there was nothing more to be said r oodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing room o be sitting long after dinner was a confinement that he could not endure either wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable hile he talked to sabella however mma found an opportunity of saying nd so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain am sorry for it he introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better es and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays ven if this family the raithwaites are put off am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but am sure there is a great wish on the hurchills to keep him to themselves here is jealousy hey are jealous even of his regard for his father n short can feel no dependence on his coming and wish r eston were less sanguine e ought to come said mma f he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young man s not having it in his power to do as much as that young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teazed and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young man s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it ne ought to be at nscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do replied rs eston ne ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but nscombe believe certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her ut she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite ow according to my idea of rs hurchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all y dearest mma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be mma listened and then coolly said shall not be satisfied unless he comes e may have a great deal of influence on some points continued rs eston and on others very little and among those on which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us r oodhouse was soon ready for his tea and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home and it was as much as his three companions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour before the other gentlemen appeared r eston was chatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort but at last the drawing room party did receive an augmentation r lton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in rs eston and mma were sitting together on a sofa e joined them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself between them mma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of r rank hurchill was willing to forget his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his making arriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most friendly smiles e professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend her fair lovely amiable friend id she know had she heard any thing about her since their being at andalls he felt much anxiety he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably nd in this style he talked on for some time very properly not much attending to any answer but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat and mma was quite in charity with him ut at last there seemed a perverse turn it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account than on arriet s more anxious that she should escape the infection than that there should be no infection in the complaint e began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick chamber again for the present to entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen r erry and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her he was vexed t did appear there was no concealing it exactly like the pretence of being in love with her instead of arriet an inconstancy if real the most contemptible and abominable and she had difficulty in behaving with temper e turned to rs eston to implore her assistance ould not she give him her support would not she add her persuasions to his to induce iss oodhouse not to go to rs oddard s till it were certain that iss mith s disorder had no infection e could not be satisfied without a promise would not she give him her influence in procuring it o scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless for herself he wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to day and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself s this fair rs eston udge between us ave not some right to complain am sure of your kind support and aid mma saw rs eston s surprize and felt that it must be great at an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her and as for herself she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose he could only give him a look but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses and then left the sofa removing to a seat by her sister and giving her all her attention he had not time to know how r lton took the reproof so rapidly did another subject succeed for r ohn nightley now came into the room from examining the weather and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow and of its still snowing fast with a strong drifting wind concluding with these words to r oodhouse his will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements sir omething new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow oor r oodhouse was silent from consternation but every body else had something to say every body was either surprized or not surprized and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer rs eston and mma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son in law who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon very body must have seen the snow coming on admired your spirit and dare say we shall get home very well nother hour or two s snow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand dare say we shall be all safe at artfield before midnight r eston with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word lest it should make r oodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse for his hurrying away s to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke he was afraid they would find no difficulty e wished the road might be impassable that he might be able to keep them all at andalls and with the utmost good will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body calling on his wife to agree with him that with a little contrivance every body might be lodged which she hardly knew how to do from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house hat is to be done my dear mma what is to be done was r oodhouse s first exclamation and all that he could say for some time o her he looked for comfort and her assurances of safety her representation of the excellence of the horses and of ames and of their having so many friends about them revived him a little is eldest daughter s alarm was equal to his own he horror of being blocked up at andalls while her children were at artfield was full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay she was eager to have it settled that her father and mma should remain at andalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them ou had better order the carriage directly my love said she dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad can get out and walk am not at all afraid should not mind walking half the way could change my shoes you know the moment got home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold ndeed replied he hen my dear sabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold alk home you are prettily shod for walking home dare say t will be bad enough for the horses sabella turned to rs eston for her approbation of the plan rs eston could only approve sabella then went to mma but mma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away and they were still discussing the point when r nightley who had left the room immediately after his brother s first report of the snow came back again and told them that he had been out of doors to examine and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home whenever they liked it either now or an hour hence e had gone beyond the sweep some way along the ighbury road the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground a very few flakes were falling at present but the clouds were parting and there was every appearance of its being soon over e had seen the coachmen and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend o sabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they were scarcely less acceptable to mma on her father s account who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at andalls e was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending r nightley and mma settled it in a few brief sentences thus our father will not be easy why do not you go am ready if the others are hall ring the bell es do nd the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for few minutes more and mma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house to get sober and cool and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over he carriage came and r oodhouse always the first object on such occasions was carefully attended to his own by r nightley and r eston but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for e was afraid they should have a very bad drive e was afraid poor sabella would not like it nd there would be poor mma in the carriage behind e did not know what they had best do hey must keep as much together as they could and ames was talked to and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage sabella stept in after her father ohn nightley forgetting that he did not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally so that mma found on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by r lton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them and that they were to have a tete a tete drive t would not have been the awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure previous to the suspicions of this very day she could have talked to him of arriet and the three quarters of a mile would have seemed but one ut now she would rather it had not happened he believed he had been drinking too much of r eston s good wine and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense o restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night but scarcely had she begun scarcely had they passed the sweep gate and joined the other carriage than she found her subject cut up her hand seized her attention demanded and r lton actually making violent love to her availing himself of the precious opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already well known hoping fearing adoring ready to die if she refused him but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect and in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible t really was so ithout scruple without apology without much apparent diffidence r lton the lover of arriet was professing himself her lover he tried to stop him but vainly he would go on and say it all ngry as she was the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak he felt that half this folly must be drunkenness and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour ccordingly with a mixture of the serious and the playful which she hoped would best suit his half and half state she replied am very much astonished r lton his to me you forget yourself you take me for my friend any message to iss mith shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please iss mith message to iss mith hat could she possibly mean nd he repeated her words with such assurance of accent such boastful pretence of amazement that she could not help replying with quickness r lton this is the most extraordinary conduct and can account for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak either to me or of arriet in such a manner ommand yourself enough to say no more and will endeavour to forget it ut r lton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits not at all to confuse his intellects e perfectly knew his own meaning and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious and slightly touched upon his respect for iss mith as her friend but acknowledging his wonder that iss mith should be mentioned at all he resumed the subject of his own passion and was very urgent for a favourable answer s she thought less of his inebriety she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption and with fewer struggles for politeness replied t is impossible for me to doubt any longer ou have made yourself too clear r lton my astonishment is much beyond any thing can express fter such behaviour as have witnessed during the last month to iss mith such attentions as have been in the daily habit of observing to be addressing me in this manner this is an unsteadiness of character indeed which had not supposed possible elieve me sir am far very far from gratified in being the object of such professions ood eaven cried r lton what can be the meaning of this iss mith never thought of iss mith in the whole course of my existence never paid her any attentions but as your friend never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend f she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her and am very sorry extremely sorry ut iss mith indeed h iss oodhouse who can think of iss mith when iss oodhouse is near o upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character have thought only of you protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else very thing that have said or done for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself ou cannot really seriously doubt it o in an accent meant to be insinuating am sure you have seen and understood me t would be impossible to say what mma felt on hearing this which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost he was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for r lton s sanguine state of mind he tried to take her hand again as he joyously exclaimed harming iss oodhouse allow me to interpret this interesting silence t confesses that you have long understood me o sir cried mma it confesses no such thing o far from having long understood you have been in a most complete error with respect to your views till this moment s to myself am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings othing could be farther from my wishes your attachment to my friend arriet your pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me great pleasure and have been very earnestly wishing you success but had supposed that she were not your attraction to artfield should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent m to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to iss mith that you have never thought seriously of her ever madam cried he affronted in his turn never assure you think seriously of iss mith iss mith is a very good sort of girl and should be happy to see her respectably settled wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object to very body has their level but as for myself am not think quite so much at a loss need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to iss mith o madam my visits to artfield have been for yourself only and the encouragement received ncouragement give you encouragement ir you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it have seen you only as the admirer of my friend n no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance am exceedingly sorry but it is well that the mistake ends where it does ad the same behaviour continued iss mith might have been led into a misconception of your views not being aware probably any more than myself of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of ut as it is the disappointment is single and trust will not be lasting have no thoughts of matrimony at present e was too angry to say another word her manner too decided to invite supplication and in this state of swelling resentment and mutually deep mortification they had to continue together a few minutes longer for the fears of r oodhouse had confined them to a foot pace f there had not been so much anger there would have been desperate awkwardness but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment ithout knowing when the carriage turned into icarage ane or when it stopped they found themselves all at once at the door of his house and he was out before another syllable passed mma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night he compliment was just returned coldly and proudly and under indescribable irritation of spirits she was then conveyed to artfield here she was welcomed with the utmost delight by her father who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from icarage ane turning a corner which he could never bear to think of and in strange hands a mere common coachman no ames and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well for r ohn nightley ashamed of his ill humour was now all kindness and attention and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father as to seem if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party except herself ut her mind had never been in such perturbation and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection he hair was curled and the maid sent away and mma sat down to think and be miserable t was a wretched business indeed uch an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for uch a development of every thing most unwelcome uch a blow for arriet that was the worst of all very part of it brought pain and humiliation of some sort or other but compared with the evil to arriet all was light and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken more in error more disgraced by mis judgment than she actually was could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself f had not persuaded arriet into liking the man could have borne any thing e might have doubled his presumption to me but poor arriet ow she could have been so deceived e protested that he had never thought seriously of arriet never he looked back as well as she could but it was all confusion he had taken up the idea she supposed and made every thing bend to it is manners however must have been unmarked wavering dubious or she could not have been so misled he picture ow eager he had been about the picture and the charade and an hundred other circumstances how clearly they had seemed to point at arriet o be sure the charade with its ready wit but then the soft eyes in fact it suited neither it was a jumble without taste or truth ho could have seen through such thick headed nonsense ertainly she had often especially of late thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant but it had passed as his way as a mere error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society that with all the gentleness of his address true elegance was sometimes wanting but till this very day she had never for an instant suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as arriet s friend o r ohn nightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject for the first start of its possibility here was no denying that those brothers had penetration he remembered what r nightley had once said to her about r lton the caution he had given the conviction he had professed that r lton would never marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself t was dreadfully mortifying but r lton was proving himself in many respects the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him proud assuming conceited very full of his own claims and little concerned about the feelings of others ontrary to the usual course of things r lton s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion is professions and his proposals did him no service he thought nothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes e wanted to marry well and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her pretended to be in love but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for here had been no real affection either in his language or manners ighs and fine words had been given in abundance but she could hardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice less allied with real love he need not trouble herself to pity him e only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if iss oodhouse of artfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for iss omebody else with twenty or with ten ut that he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to marry him should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind look down upon her friend so well understanding the gradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her t was most provoking erhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind he very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior e must know that the oodhouses had been settled for several generations at artfield the younger branch of a very ancient family and that the ltons were nobody he landed property of artfield certainly was inconsiderable being but a sort of notch in the onwell bbey estate to which all the rest of ighbury belonged but their fortune from other sources was such as to make them scarcely secondary to onwell bbey itself in every other kind of consequence and the oodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which r lton had first entered not two years ago to make his way as he could without any alliances but in trade or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility ut he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must have been his dependence and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head mma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of courtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy like r lton in fancying himself a very decided favourite f she had so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to wonder that he with self interest to blind him should have mistaken hers he first error and the worst lay at her door t was foolish it was wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two people together t was adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what ought to be serious a trick of what ought to be simple he was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved to do such things no more ere have said she actually talked poor arriet into being very much attached to this man he might never have thought of him but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope if had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble as used to think him h that had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young artin here was quite right hat was well done of me but there should have stopped and left the rest to time and chance was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ought not to have attempted more ut now poor girl her peace is cut up for some time have been but half a friend to her and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much am sure have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her illiam oxe h no could not endure illiam oxe a pert young lawyer he stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumed a more serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been and might be and must be he distressing explanation she had to make to arriet and all that poor arriet would be suffering with the awkwardness of future meetings the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance of subduing feelings concealing resentment and avoiding eclat were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully o youth and natural cheerfulness like mma s though under temporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits he youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy and of powerful operation and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope mma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her and to depend on getting tolerably out of it t was a great consolation that r lton should not be really in love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him that arriet s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive and that there could be no necessity for any body s knowing what had passed except the three principals and especially for her father s being given a moment s uneasiness about it hese were very cheering thoughts and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present he weather was most favourable for her though hristmas ay she could not go to church r oodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas he ground covered with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise every morning beginning in rain or snow and every evening setting in to freeze she was for many days a most honourable prisoner o intercourse with arriet possible but by note no church for her on unday any more than on hristmas ay and no need to find excuses for r lton s absenting himself t was weather which might fairly confine every body at home and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house too wise to stir out and to hear him say to r nightley whom no weather could keep entirely from them h r nightley why do not you stay at home like poor r lton hese days of confinement would have been but for her private perplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly suited her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off his ill humour at andalls that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at artfield e was always agreeable and obliging and speaking pleasantly of every body ut with all the hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with arriet as made it impossible for mma to be ever perfectly at ease r and rs ohn nightley were not detained long at artfield he weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move and r oodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole party set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor sabella which poor sabella passing her life with those she doated on full of their merits blind to their faults and always innocently busy might have been a model of right feminine happiness he evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from r lton to r oodhouse a long civil ceremonious note to say with r lton s best compliments that he was proposing to leave ighbury the following morning in his way to ath where in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends he had engaged to spend a few weeks and very much regretted the impossibility he was under from various circumstances of weather and business of taking a personal leave of r oodhouse of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense and had r oodhouse any commands should be happy to attend to them mma was most agreeably surprized r lton s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired he admired him for contriving it though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced esentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father from which she was so pointedly excluded he had not even a share in his opening compliments er name was not mentioned and there was so striking a change in all this and such an ill judged solemnity of leave taking in his graceful acknowledgments as she thought at first could not escape her father s suspicion t did however er father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey and his fears that r lton might never get safely to the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language t was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening r oodhouse talked over his alarms and mma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude he now resolved to keep arriet no longer in the dark he had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman s return he went to rs oddard s accordingly the very next day to undergo the necessary penance of communication and a severe one it was he had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis judging in all her ideas on one subject all her observations all her convictions all her prophecies for the last six weeks he confession completely renewed her first shame and the sight of arriet s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again arriet bore the intelligence very well blaming nobody and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend mma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost and all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching seemed on arriet s side not her own arriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of he affection of such a man as r lton would have been too great a distinction he never could have deserved him and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as iss oodhouse would have thought it possible er tears fell abundantly but her grief was so truly artless that no dignity could have made it more respectable in mma s eyes and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding really for the time convinced that arriet was the superior creature of the two and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do t was rather too late in the day to set about being simple minded and ignorant but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet and repressing imagination all the rest of her life er second duty now inferior only to her father s claims was to promote arriet s comfort and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match making he got her to artfield and shewed her the most unvarying kindness striving to occupy and amuse her and by books and conversation to drive r lton from her thoughts ime she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to r lton in particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at arriet s age and with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of r lton s return as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them arriet did think him all perfection and maintained the non existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness and did in truth prove herself more resolutely in love than mma had foreseen but yet it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force f r lton on his return made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not imagine arriet s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him heir being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad for each for all three ot one of them had the power of removal or of effecting any material change of society hey must encounter each other and make the best of it arriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at rs oddard s r lton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school and it must be at artfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth here the wound had been given there must the cure be found if anywhere and mma felt that till she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peace for herself r rank hurchill did not come hen the time proposed drew near rs eston s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse or the present he could not be spared to his very great mortification and regret but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to andalls at no distant period rs eston was exceedingly disappointed much more disappointed in fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober but a sanguine temper though for ever expecting more good than occurs does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression t soon flies over the present failure and begins to hope again or half an hour r eston was surprized and sorry but then he began to perceive that rank s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan better time of year better weather and that he would be able without any doubt to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner hese feelings rapidly restored his comfort while rs eston of a more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer suffered a great deal more herself mma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about r rank hurchill s not coming except as a disappointment at andalls he acquaintance at present had no charm for her he wanted rather to be quiet and out of temptation but still as it was desirable that she should appear in general like her usual self she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance and enter as warmly into r and rs eston s disappointment as might naturally belong to their friendship he was the first to announce it to r nightley and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary or being acting a part perhaps rather more at the conduct of the hurchills in keeping him away he then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in urry the pleasure of looking at somebody new the gala day to ighbury entire which the sight of him would have made and ending with reflections on the hurchills again found herself directly involved in a disagreement with r nightley and to her great amusement perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion and making use of rs eston s arguments against herself he hurchills are very likely in fault said r nightley coolly but dare say he might come if he would do not know why you should say so e wishes exceedingly to come but his uncle and aunt will not spare him cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a point of it t is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof ow odd you are hat has r rank hurchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it t is a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too f rank hurchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between eptember and anuary man at his age what is he three or four and twenty cannot be without the means of doing as much as that t is impossible hat s easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master ou are the worst judge in the world r nightley of the difficulties of dependence ou do not know what it is to have tempers to manage t is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount e cannot want money he cannot want leisure e know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom e hear of him for ever at some watering place or other little while ago he was at eymouth his proves that he can leave the hurchills es sometimes he can nd those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure t is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation obody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be e ought to be acquainted with nscombe and with rs hurchill s temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do e may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others here is one thing mma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution t is rank hurchill s duty to pay this attention to his father e knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to rs hurchill very sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but must go and see my father immediately know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion shall therefore set off to morrow f he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going o said mma laughing but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again uch language for a young man entirely dependent to use obody but you r nightley would imagine it possible ut you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own r rank hurchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him tanding up in the middle of the room suppose and speaking as loud as he could ow can you imagine such conduct practicable epend upon it mma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it e would feel himself in the right and the declaration made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do espect would be added to affection hey would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims espect for right conduct is felt by every body f he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his rather doubt that ou are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones can imagine that if you as you are r nightley were to be transported and placed all at once in r rank hurchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect he hurchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through o him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought e may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it hen it would not be so strong a sense f it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction h the difference of situation and habit wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life ur amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others t ought to have been a habit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man s he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority e ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father ad he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now e shall never agree about him cried mma but that is nothing extraordinary have not the least idea of his being a weak young man feel sure that he is not r eston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of man s perfection dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others es all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it e can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father s having any right to complain is letters disgust me our feelings are singular hey seem to satisfy every body else suspect they do not satisfy rs eston hey hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mother s place but without a mother s affection to blind her t is on her account that attention to andalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission ad she been a person of consequence herself he would have come dare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no an you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations o you suppose she does not often say all this to herself o mma your amiable young man can be amiable only in rench not in nglish e may be very aimable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no nglish delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him ou seem determined to think ill of him e not at all replied r nightley rather displeased do not want to think ill of him should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man but hear of none except what are merely personal that he is well grown and good looking with smooth plausible manners ell if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at ighbury e do not often look upon fine young men well bred and agreeable e must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain annot you imagine r nightley what a sensation his coming will produce here will be but one subject throughout the parishes of onwell and ighbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all r rank hurchill we shall think and speak of nobody else ou will excuse my being so much over powered f find him conversable shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts y idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable o you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him nd mine said r nightley warmly is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing hat at three and twenty to be the king of his company the great man the practised politician who is to read every body s character and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself y dear mma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point will say no more about him cried mma you turn every thing to evil e are both prejudiced you against for him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here rejudiced am not prejudiced ut am very much and without being at all ashamed of it y love for r and rs eston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour e is a person never think of from one month s end to another said r nightley with a degree of vexation which made mma immediately talk of something else though she could not comprehend why he should be angry o take a dislike to a young man only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him for with all the high opinion of himself which she had often laid to his charge she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another mma and arriet had been walking together one morning and in mma s opinion had been talking enough of r lton for that day he could not think that arriet s solace or her own sins required more and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive r lton is so good to the poor she found something else must be done hey were just approaching the house where lived rs and iss ates he determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers here was always sufficient reason for such an attention rs and iss ates loved to be called on and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her as rather negligent in that respect and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts he had had many a hint from r nightley and some from her own heart as to her deficiency but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable a waste of time tiresome women and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second rate and third rate of ighbury who were calling on them for ever and therefore she seldom went near them ut now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in observing as she proposed it to arriet that as well as she could calculate they were just now quite safe from any letter from ane airfax he house belonged to people in business rs and iss ates occupied the drawing room floor and there in the very moderate sized apartment which was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed the quiet neat old lady who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up her place to iss oodhouse and her more active talking daughter almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for their visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after r oodhouse s health cheerful communications about her mother s and sweet cake from the beaufet rs ole had just been there just called in for ten minutes and had been so good as to sit an hour with them and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much and therefore she hoped iss oodhouse and iss mith would do them the favour to eat a piece too he mention of the oles was sure to be followed by that of r lton here was intimacy between them and r ole had heard from r lton since his going away mma knew what was coming they must have the letter over again and settle how long he had been gone and how much he was engaged in company and what a favourite he was wherever he went and how full the aster of the eremonies ball had been and she went through it very well with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite and always putting forward to prevent arriet s being obliged to say a word his she had been prepared for when she entered the house but meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst all the istresses and isses of ighbury and their card parties he had not been prepared to have ane airfax succeed r lton but he was actually hurried off by iss ates she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the oles to usher in a letter from her niece h yes r lton understand certainly as to dancing rs ole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at ath was rs ole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of ane for as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her ane is so very great a favourite there henever she is with us rs ole does not know how to shew her kindness enough and must say that ane deserves it as much as any body can nd so she began inquiring after her directly saying know you cannot have heard from ane lately because it is not her time for writing and when immediately said ut indeed we have we had a letter this very morning do not know that ever saw any body more surprized ave you upon your honour said she well that is quite unexpected o let me hear what she says mma s politeness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest ave you heard from iss airfax so lately am extremely happy hope she is well hank you ou are so kind replied the happily deceived aunt while eagerly hunting for the letter h here it is was sure it could not be far off but had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid but had it in my hand so very lately that was almost sure it must be on the table was reading it to rs ole and since she went away was reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her a letter from ane that she can never hear it often enough so knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswife and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says but first of all really must in justice to ane apologise for her writing so short a letter only two pages you see hardly two and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half y mother often wonders that can make it out so well he often says when the letter is first opened ell etty now think you will be put to it to make out all that checker work don t you ma am nd then tell her am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her every word of it am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word nd indeed though my mother s eyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank od with the help of spectacles t is such a blessing y mother s are really very good indeed ane often says when she is here am sure grandmama you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do and so much fine work as you have done too only wish my eyes may last me as well ll this spoken extremely fast obliged iss ates to stop for breath and mma said something very civil about the excellence of iss airfax s handwriting ou are extremely kind replied iss ates highly gratified you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself am sure there is nobody s praise that could give us so much pleasure as iss oodhouse s y mother does not hear she is a little deaf you know a am addressing her do you hear what iss oodhouse is so obliging to say about ane s handwriting nd mma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it he was pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming very rude of making her escape from ane airfax s letter and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse when iss ates turned to her again and seized her attention y mother s deafness is very trifling you see just nothing at all y only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice ut it is very remarkable that she should always hear ane better than she does me ane speaks so distinct owever she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great deal at my mother s time of life and it really is full two years you know since she was here e never were so long without seeing her before and as was telling rs ole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now re you expecting iss airfax here soon h yes next week ndeed that must be a very great pleasure hank you ou are very kind es next week very body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at ighbury as they can be to see her es riday or aturday she cannot say which because olonel ampbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days o very good of them to send her the whole way ut they always do you know h yes riday or aturday next hat is what she writes about hat is the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have heard from her before next uesday or ednesday es so imagined was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of iss airfax to day o obliging of you o we should not have heard if it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon y mother is so delighted for she is to be three months with us at least hree months she says so positively as am going to have the pleasure of reading to you he case is you see that the ampbells are going to reland rs ixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly hey had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so impatient to see them again for till she married last ctober she was never away from them so much as a week which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms was going to say but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother or her father declare do not know which it was but we shall see presently in ane s letter wrote in r ixon s name as well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would give them the meeting in ublin and take them back to their country seat aly craig a beautiful place fancy ane has heard a great deal of its beauty from r ixon mean do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses and as ane used to be very often walking out with them for olonel and rs ampbell were very particular about their daughter s not walking out often with only r ixon for which do not at all blame them of course she heard every thing he might be telling iss ampbell about his own home in reland and think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had taken himself e is a most amiable charming young man believe ane was quite longing to go to reland from his account of things t this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering mma s brain with regard to ane airfax this charming r ixon and the not going to reland she said with the insidious design of farther discovery ou must feel it very fortunate that iss airfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time onsidering the very particular friendship between her and rs ixon you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying olonel and rs ampbell ery true very true indeed he very thing that we have always been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us for months together not able to come if any thing was to happen ut you see every thing turns out for the best hey want her r and rs ixon excessively to come over with olonel and rs ampbell quite depend upon it nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation ane says as you will hear presently r ixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention e is a most charming young man ver since the service he rendered ane at eymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit can never think of it without trembling ut ever since we had the history of that day have been so fond of r ixon ut in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish of seeing reland iss airfax prefers devoting the time to you and rs ates es entirely her own doing entirely her own choice and olonel and rs ampbell think she does quite right just what they should recommend and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately am concerned to hear of it think they judge wisely ut rs ixon must be very much disappointed rs ixon understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not by any means to be compared with iss airfax h no ou are very obliging to say such things but certainly not here is no comparison between them iss ampbell always was absolutely plain but extremely elegant and amiable es that of course ane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the th of ovember as am going to read to you and has never been well since long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her he never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us ust like her so considerate ut however she is so far from well that her kind friends the ampbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at ighbury will entirely cure her and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here than go to reland if she is unwell obody could nurse her as we should do t appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world nd so she is to come to us next riday or aturday and the ampbells leave town in their way to olyhead the onday following as you will find from ane s letter o sudden ou may guess dear iss oodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in f it was not for the drawback of her illness but am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that always make a point of reading ane s letters through to myself first before read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her ane desired me to do it so always do and so began to day with my usual caution but no sooner did come to the mention of her being unwell than burst out quite frightened with less me poor ane is ill which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at owever when read on found it was not near so bad as had fancied at first and make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it ut cannot imagine how could be so off my guard f ane does not get well soon we will call in r erry he expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of ane that dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know e has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time ell now have just given you a hint of what ane writes about we will turn to her letter and am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than can tell it for her am afraid we must be running away said mma glancing at arriet and beginning to rise y father will be expecting us had no intention thought had no power of staying more than five minutes when first entered the house merely called because would not pass the door without inquiring after rs ates but have been so pleasantly detained ow however we must wish you and rs ates good morning nd not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded he regained the street happy in this that though much had been forced on her against her will though she had in fact heard the whole substance of ane airfax s letter she had been able to escape the letter itself ane airfax was an orphan the only child of rs ates s youngest daughter he marriage of ieut airfax of the regiment of infantry and iss ane ates had had its day of fame and pleasure hope and interest but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards and this girl y birth she belonged to ighbury and when at three years old on losing her mother she became the property the charge the consolation the fondling of her grandmother and aunt there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there of her being taught only what very limited means could command and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person good understanding and warm hearted well meaning relations ut the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny his was olonel ampbell who had very highly regarded airfax as an excellent officer and most deserving young man and farther had been indebted to him for such attentions during a severe camp fever as he believed had saved his life hese were claims which he did not learn to overlook though some years passed away from the death of poor airfax before his own return to ngland put any thing in his power hen he did return he sought out the child and took notice of her e was a married man with only one living child a girl about ane s age and ane became their guest paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all and before she was nine years old his daughter s great fondness for her and his own wish of being a real friend united to produce an offer from olonel ampbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education t was accepted and from that period ane had belonged to olonel ampbell s family and had lived with them entirely only visiting her grandmother from time to time he plan was that she should be brought up for educating others the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible o provide for her otherwise was out of olonel ampbell s power for though his income by pay and appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter s but by giving her an education he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter uch was ane airfax s history he had fallen into good hands known nothing but kindness from the ampbells and been given an excellent education iving constantly with right minded and well informed people her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture and olonel ampbell s residence being in ondon every lighter talent had been done full justice to by the attendance of first rate masters er disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do and at eighteen or nineteen she was as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children fully competent to the office of instruction herself but she was too much beloved to be parted with either father nor mother could promote and the daughter could not endure it he evil day was put off t was easy to decide that she was still too young and ane remained with them sharing as another daughter in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society and a judicious mixture of home and amusement with only the drawback of the future the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over he affection of the whole family the warm attachment of iss ampbell in particular was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of ane s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements hat nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents hey continued together with unabated regard however till the marriage of iss ampbell who by that chance that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior engaged the affections of r ixon a young man rich and agreeable almost as soon as they were acquainted and was eligibly and happily settled while ane airfax had yet her bread to earn his event had very lately taken place too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning he had long resolved that one and twenty should be the period ith the fortitude of a devoted novitiate she had resolved at one and twenty to complete the sacrifice and retire from all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse equal society peace and hope to penance and mortification for ever he good sense of olonel and rs ampbell could not oppose such a resolution though their feelings did s long as they lived no exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly but this would be selfishness what must be at last had better be soon erhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished till however affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment he had never been quite well since the time of their daughter s marriage and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength they must forbid her engaging in duties which so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits seemed under the most favourable circumstances to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort ith regard to her not accompanying them to reland her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some truths not told t was her own choice to give the time of their absence to ighbury to spend perhaps her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear and the ampbells whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air for the recovery of her health than on any thing else ertain it was that she was to come and that ighbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it r rank hurchill must put up for the present with ane airfax who could bring only the freshness of a two years absence mma was sorry to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months to be always doing more than she wished and less than she ought hy she did not like ane airfax might be a difficult question to answer r nightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman which she wanted to be thought herself and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time there were moments of self examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her ut she could never get acquainted with her she did not know how it was but there was such coldness and reserve such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not and then her aunt was such an eternal talker and she was made such a fuss with by every body and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate because their ages were the same every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other hese were her reasons she had no better t was a dislike so little just every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy that she never saw ane airfax the first time after any considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her and now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating ane airfax was very elegant remarkably elegant and she had herself the highest value for elegance er height was pretty just such as almost every body would think tall and nobody could think very tall her figure particularly graceful her size a most becoming medium between fat and thin though a slight appearance of ill health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two mma could not but feel all this and then her face her features there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered it was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty er eyes a deep grey with dark eye lashes and eyebrows had never been denied their praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at as wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom t was a style of beauty of which elegance was the reigning character and as such she must in honour by all her principles admire it elegance which whether of person or of mind she saw so little in ighbury here not to be vulgar was distinction and merit n short she sat during the first visit looking at ane airfax with twofold complacency the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice and was determining that she would dislike her no longer hen she took in her history indeed her situation as well as her beauty when she considered what all this elegance was destined to what she was going to sink from how she was going to live it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect especially if to every well known particular entitling her to interest were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to r ixon which she had so naturally started to herself n that case nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on mma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced r ixon s actions from his wife or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first f it were love it might be simple single successless love on her side alone he might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison while a sharer of his conversation with her friend and from the best the purest of motives might now be denying herself this visit to reland and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty pon the whole mma left her with such softened charitable feelings as made her look around in walking home and lament that ighbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her hese were charming feelings but not lasting efore she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for ane airfax or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors than saying to r nightley he certainly is handsome she is better than handsome ane had spent an evening at artfield with her grandmother and aunt and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state ormer provocations reappeared he aunt was as tiresome as ever more tiresome because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast and how small a slice of mutton for dinner as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself and ane s offences rose again hey had music mma was obliged to play and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour an air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance he was besides which was the worst of all so cold so cautious here was no getting at her real opinion rapt up in a cloak of politeness she seemed determined to hazard nothing he was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved f any thing could be more where all was most she was more reserved on the subject of eymouth and the ixons than any thing he seemed bent on giving no real insight into r ixon s character or her own value for his company or opinion of the suitableness of the match t was all general approbation and smoothness nothing delineated or distinguished t did her no service however er caution was thrown away mma saw its artifice and returned to her first surmises here probably was something more to conceal than her own preference r ixon perhaps had been very near changing one friend for the other or been fixed only to iss ampbell for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds he like reserve prevailed on other topics he and r rank hurchill had been at eymouth at the same time t was known that they were a little acquainted but not a syllable of real information could mma procure as to what he truly was as he handsome he believed he was reckoned a very fine young man as he agreeable e was generally thought so id he appear a sensible young man a young man of information t a watering place or in a common ondon acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points anners were all that could be safely judged of under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of r hurchill he believed every body found his manners pleasing mma could not forgive her mma could not forgive her but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by r nightley who had been of the party and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side he was expressing the next morning being at artfield again on business with r oodhouse his approbation of the whole not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to mma e had been used to think her unjust to ane and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement very pleasant evening he began as soon as r oodhouse had been talked into what was necessary told that he understood and the papers swept away particularly pleasant ou and iss airfax gave us some very good music do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at one s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation am sure iss airfax must have found the evening pleasant mma ou left nothing undone was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmother s it must have been a real indulgence am happy you approved said mma smiling but hope am not often deficient in what is due to guests at artfield o my dear said her father instantly that am sure you are not here is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are f any thing you are too attentive he muffin last night if it had been handed round once think it would have been enough o said r nightley nearly at the same time you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension think you understand me therefore n arch look expressed understand you well enough but she said only iss airfax is reserved always told you she was a little but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that has its foundation in diffidence hat arises from discretion must be honoured ou think her diffident do not see it y dear mma said he moving from his chair into one close by her you are not going to tell me hope that you had not a pleasant evening h no was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information obtained am disappointed was his only answer hope every body had a pleasant evening said r oodhouse in his quiet way had nce felt the fire rather too much but then moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me iss ates was very chatty and good humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick owever she is very agreeable and rs ates too in a different way like old friends and iss ane airfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed he must have found the evening agreeable r nightley because she had mma rue sir and mma because she had iss airfax mma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for the present said and with a sincerity which no one could question he is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from am always watching her to admire and do pity her from my heart r nightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express and before he could make any reply r oodhouse whose thoughts were on the ates s said t is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined a great pity indeed and have often wished but it is so little one can venture to do small trifling presents of any thing uncommon ow we have killed a porker and mma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg it is very small and delicate artfield pork is not like any other pork but still it is pork and my dear mma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast pork think we had better send the leg do not you think so my dear y dear papa sent the whole hind quarter knew you would wish it here will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like hat s right my dear very right had not thought of it before but that is the best way hey must not over salt the leg and then if it is not over salted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as erle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip do not consider it unwholesome mma said r nightley presently have a piece of news for you ou like news and heard an article in my way hither that think will interest you ews h yes always like news hat is it why do you smile so where did you hear it at andalls e had time only to say o not at andalls have not been near andalls when the door was thrown open and iss ates and iss airfax walked into the room ull of thanks and full of news iss ates knew not which to give quickest r nightley soon saw that he had lost his moment and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him h my dear sir how are you this morning y dear iss oodhouse come quite over powered uch a beautiful hind quarter of pork ou are too bountiful ave you heard the news r lton is going to be married mma had not had time even to think of r lton and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start and a little blush at the sound here is my news thought it would interest you said r nightley with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them ut where could you hear it cried iss ates here could you possibly hear it r nightley or it is not five minutes since received rs ole s note no it cannot be more than five or at least ten for had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready to come out was only gone down to speak to atty again about the pork ane was standing in the passage were not you ane for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting pan large enough o said would go down and see and ane said hall go down instead for think you have a little cold and atty has been washing the kitchen h my dear said well and just then came the note iss awkins that s all know iss awkins of ath ut r nightley how could you possibly have heard it for the very moment r ole told rs ole of it she sat down and wrote to me iss awkins was with r ole on business an hour and a half ago e had just read lton s letter as was shewn in and handed it to me directly ell that is quite suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting y dear sir you really are too bountiful y mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a thousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her e consider our artfield pork replied r oodhouse indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that mma and cannot have a greater pleasure than h my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us f ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for am sure it is us e may well say that our lot is cast in a goodly heritage ell r nightley and so you actually saw the letter well t was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course ere was a sly glance at mma e had been so fortunate as to forget the precise words one has no business to remember them he information was as you state that he was going to be married to a iss awkins y his style should imagine it just settled r lton going to be married said mma as soon as she could speak e will have every body s wishes for his happiness e is very young to settle was r oodhouse s observation e had better not be in a hurry e seemed to me very well off as he was e were always glad to see him at artfield new neighbour for us all iss oodhouse said iss ates joyfully my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old icarage without a mistress his is great news indeed ane you have never seen r lton no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him ane s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her o have never seen r lton she replied starting on this appeal is he is he a tall man ho shall answer that question cried mma y father would say yes r nightley no and iss ates and that he is just the happy medium hen you have been here a little longer iss airfax you will understand that r lton is the standard of perfection in ighbury both in person and mind ery true iss oodhouse so she will e is the very best young man ut my dear ane if you remember told you yesterday he was precisely the height of r erry iss awkins dare say an excellent young woman is extreme attention to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you know it is not much but she does not hear quite quick ane says that olonel ampbell is a little deaf e fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath but she says it did him no lasting benefit olonel ampbell you know is quite our angel nd r ixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him t is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do ow here will be r lton and iss awkins and there are the oles such very good people and the errys suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than r and rs erry say sir turning to r oodhouse think there are few places with such society as ighbury always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours y dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork s to who or what iss awkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her said mma nothing suppose can be known ne feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance e has been gone only four weeks obody had any information to give and after a few more wonderings mma said ou are silent iss airfax but hope you mean to take an interest in this news ou who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on iss ampbell s account we shall not excuse your being indifferent about r lton and iss awkins hen have seen r lton replied ane dare say shall be interested but believe it requires that with me nd as it is some months since iss ampbell married the impression may be a little worn off es he has been gone just four weeks as you observe iss oodhouse said iss ates four weeks yesterday iss awkins ell had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not that ever rs ole once whispered to me but immediately said o r lton is a most worthy young man but n short do not think am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries do not pretend to it hat is before me see t the same time nobody could wonder if r lton should have aspired iss oodhouse lets me chatter on so good humouredly he knows would not offend for the world ow does iss mith do he seems quite recovered now ave you heard from rs ohn nightley lately h those dear little children ane do you know always fancy r ixon like r ohn nightley mean in person tall and with that sort of look and not very talkative uite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all ery odd but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand ne takes up a notion and runs away with it r ixon you say is not strictly speaking handsome andsome h no far from it certainly plain told you he was plain y dear you said that iss ampbell would not allow him to be plain and that you yourself h as for me my judgment is worth nothing here have a regard always think a person well looking ut gave what believed the general opinion when called him plain ell my dear ane believe we must be running away he weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy ou are too obliging my dear iss oodhouse but we really must take leave his has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed shall just go round by rs ole s but shall not stop three minutes and ane you had better go home directly would not have you out in a shower e think she is the better for ighbury already hank you we do indeed shall not attempt calling on rs oddard for really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork when we dress the leg it will be another thing ood morning to you my dear sir h r nightley is coming too ell that is so very am sure if ane is tired you will be so kind as to give her your arm r lton and iss awkins ood morning to you mma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry and to marry strangers too and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject t was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news as proving that r lton could not have suffered long but she was sorry for arriet arriet must feel it and all that she could hope was by giving the first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly from others t was now about the time that she was likely to call f she were to meet iss ates in her way and upon its beginning to rain mma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at rs oddard s and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation he shower was heavy but short and it had not been over five minutes when in came arriet with just the heated agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give and the h iss oodhouse what do you think has happened which instantly burst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation s the blow was given mma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening and arriet unchecked ran eagerly through what she had to tell he had set out from rs oddard s half an hour ago she had been afraid it would rain she had been afraid it would pour down every moment but she thought she might get to artfield first she had hurried on as fast as possible but then as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her she thought she would just step in and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain and she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast as she could and took shelter at ord s ord s was the principal woollen draper linen draper and haberdasher s shop united the shop first in size and fashion in the place nd so there she had set without an idea of any thing in the world full ten minutes perhaps when all of a sudden who should come in to be sure it was so very odd but they always dealt at ord s who should come in but lizabeth artin and her brother ear iss oodhouse only think thought should have fainted did not know what to do was sitting near the door lizabeth saw me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop and kept sitting near the door h dear was so miserable am sure must have been as white as my gown could not go away you know because of the rain but did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there h dear iss oodhouse well at last fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going on with her buyings they began whispering to one another am sure they were talking of me and could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me do you think he was iss oodhouse for presently she came forward came quite up to me and asked me how did and seemed ready to shake hands if would he did not do any of it in the same way that she used could see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time but know no more what said was in such a tremble remember she said she was sorry we never met now which thought almost too kind ear iss oodhouse was absolutely miserable y that time it was beginning to hold up and was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away and then only think found he was coming up towards me too slowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke and answered and stood for a minute feeling dreadfully you know one can t tell how and then took courage and said it did not rain and must go and so off set and had not got three yards from the door when he came after me only to say if was going to artfield he thought had much better go round by r ole s stables for should find the near way quite floated by this rain h dear thought it would have been the death of me o said was very much obliged to him you know could not do less and then he went back to lizabeth and came round by the stables believe did but hardly knew where was or any thing about it h iss oodhouse would rather done any thing than have it happen and yet you know there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly nd lizabeth too h iss oodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again ery sincerely did mma wish to do so but it was not immediately in her power he was obliged to stop and think he was not thoroughly comfortable herself he young man s conduct and his sister s seemed the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them s arriet described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour ut she had believed them to be well meaning worthy people before and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion t was folly to be disturbed by it f course he must be sorry to lose her they must be all sorry mbition as well as love had probably been mortified hey might all have hoped to rise by arriet s acquaintance and besides what was the value of arriet s description o easily pleased so little discerning what signified her praise he exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle and quite unworthy of being dwelt on t might be distressing for the moment said she but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over and may never can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it arriet said very true and she would not think about it but still she talked of it still she could talk of nothing else and mma at last in order to put the artins out of her head was obliged to hurry on the news which she had meant to give with so much tender caution hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry ashamed or only amused at such a state of mind in poor arriet such a conclusion of r lton s importance with her r lton s rights however gradually revived hough she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before or an hour before its interest soon increased and before their first conversation was over she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure as to this fortunate iss awkins which could conduce to place the artins under proper subordination in her fancy mma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting t had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining any influence to alarm s arriet now lived the artins could not get at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her for since her refusal of the brother the sisters never had been at rs oddard s and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again with any necessity or even any power of speech uman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations that a young person who either marries or dies is sure of being kindly spoken of week had not passed since iss awkins s name was first mentioned in ighbury before she was by some means or other discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind to be handsome elegant highly accomplished and perfectly amiable and when r lton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects and circulate the fame of her merits there was very little more for him to do than to tell her hristian name and say whose music she principally played r lton returned a very happy man e had gone away rejected and mortified disappointed in a very sanguine hope after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement and not only losing the right lady but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one e had gone away deeply offended he came back engaged to another and to another as superior of course to the first as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost e came back gay and self satisfied eager and busy caring nothing for iss oodhouse and defying iss mith he charming ugusta awkins in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune of so many thousands as would always be called ten a point of some dignity as well as some convenience the story told well he had not thrown himself away he had gained a woman of l or thereabouts and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice the history which he had to give rs ole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious the steps so quick from the accidental rencontre to the dinner at r reen s and the party at rs rown s smiles and blushes rising in importance with consciousness and agitation richly scattered the lady had been so easily impressed so sweetly disposed had in short to use a most intelligible phrase been so very ready to have him that vanity and prudence were equally contented e had caught both substance and shadow both fortune and affection and was just the happy man he ought to be talking only of himself and his own concerns expecting to be congratulated ready to be laughed at and with cordial fearless smiles now addressing all the young ladies of the place to whom a few weeks ago he would have been more cautiously gallant he wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves to please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for and when he set out for ath again there was a general expectation which a certain glance of rs ole s did not seem to contradict that when he next entered ighbury he would bring his bride uring his present short stay mma had barely seen him but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension now spread over his air he was in fact beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings that except in a moral light as a penance a lesson a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again he wished him very well but he gave her pain and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction he pain of his continued residence in ighbury however must certainly be lessened by his marriage any vain solicitudes would be prevented many awkwardnesses smoothed by it rs lton would be an excuse for any change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark t would be almost beginning their life of civility again f the lady individually mma thought very little he was good enough for r lton no doubt accomplished enough for ighbury handsome enough to look plain probably by arriet s side s to connexion there mma was perfectly easy persuaded that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of arriet he had done nothing n that article truth seemed attainable hat she was must be uncertain but who she was might be found out and setting aside the l it did not appear that she was at all arriet s superior he brought no name no blood no alliance iss awkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a ristol merchant of course he must be called but as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also art of every winter she had been used to spend in ath but ristol was her home the very heart of ristol for though the father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remained in the law line nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him than that he was in the law line and with him the daughter had lived mma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney and too stupid to rise nd all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister who was very well married to a gentleman in a great way near ristol who kept two carriages hat was the wind up of the history that was the glory of iss awkins ould she but have given arriet her feelings about it all he had talked her into love but alas she was not so easily to be talked out of it he charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of arriet s mind was not to be talked away e might be superseded by another he certainly would indeed nothing could be clearer even a obert artin would have been sufficient but nothing else she feared would cure her arriet was one of those who having once begun would be always in love nd now poor girl she was considerably worse from this reappearance of r lton he was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other mma saw him only once but two or three times every day arriet was sure just to meet with him or just to miss him just to hear his voice or see his shoulder just to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture he was moreover perpetually hearing about him for excepting when at artfield she was always among those who saw no fault in r lton and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns and every report therefore every guess all that had already occurred all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs comprehending income servants and furniture was continually in agitation around her er regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him and her regrets kept alive and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of iss awkins s happiness and continual observation of how much he seemed attached his air as he walked by the house the very sitting of his hat being all in proof of how much he was in love ad it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain to her friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of arriet s mind mma would have been amused by its variations ometimes r lton predominated sometimes the artins and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other r lton s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting r artin he unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by lizabeth artin s calling at rs oddard s a few days afterwards arriet had not been at home but a note had been prepared and left for her written in the very style to touch a small mixture of reproach with a great deal of kindness and till r lton himself appeared she had been much occupied by it continually pondering over what could be done in return and wishing to do more than she dared to confess ut r lton in person had driven away all such cares hile he staid the artins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off for ath again mma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned judged it best for her to return lizabeth artin s visit ow that visit was to be acknowledged what would be necessary and what might be safest had been a point of some doubtful consideration bsolute neglect of the mother and sisters when invited to come would be ingratitude t must not be and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance fter much thinking she could determine on nothing better than arriet s returning the visit but in a way that if they had understanding should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance he meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the bbey ill while she drove a little farther and call for her again so soon as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future he could think of nothing better and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve something of ingratitude merely glossed over it must be done or what would become of arriet mall heart had arriet for visiting nly half an hour before her friend called for her at rs oddard s her evil stars had led her to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to he ev hilip lton hite art ath was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher s cart which was to convey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world excepting that trunk and the direction was consequently a blank he went however and when they reached the farm and she was to be put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between espalier apple trees to the front door the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before was beginning to revive a little local agitation and when they parted mma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour he went on herself to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married and settled in onwell he quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again and iss mith receiving her summons was with her without delay and unattended by any alarming young man he came solitarily down the gravel walk a iss artin just appearing at the door and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility arriet could not very soon give an intelligible account he was feeling too much but at last mma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it was creating he had seen only rs artin and the two girls hey had received her doubtingly if not coolly and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time till just at last when rs artin s saying all of a sudden that she thought iss mith was grown had brought on a more interesting subject and a warmer manner n that very room she had been measured last eptember with her two friends here were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window e had done it hey all seemed to remember the day the hour the party the occasion to feel the same consciousness the same regrets to be ready to return to the same good understanding and they were just growing again like themselves arriet as mma must suspect as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy when the carriage reappeared and all was over he style of the visit and the shortness of it were then felt to be decisive ourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago mma could not but picture it all and feel how justly they might resent how naturally arriet must suffer t was a bad business he would have given a great deal or endured a great deal to have had the artins in a higher rank of life hey were so deserving that a little higher should have been enough but as it was how could she have done otherwise mpossible he could not repent hey must be separated but there was a great deal of pain in the process so much to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation and resolved on going home by way of andalls to procure it er mind was quite sick of r lton and the artins he refreshment of andalls was absolutely necessary t was a good scheme but on driving to the door they heard that neither master nor mistress was at home they had both been out some time the man believed they were gone to artfield his is too bad cried mma as they turned away nd now we shall just miss them too provoking do not know when have been so disappointed nd she leaned back in the corner to indulge her murmurs or to reason them away probably a little of both such being the commonest process of a not ill disposed mind resently the carriage stopt she looked up it was stopt by r and rs eston who were standing to speak to her here was instant pleasure in the sight of them and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound for r eston immediately accosted her with ow d ye do how d ye do e have been sitting with your father glad to see him so well rank comes to morrow had a letter this morning we see him to morrow by dinner time to a certainty he is at xford to day and he comes for a whole fortnight knew it would be so f he had come at hristmas he could not have staid three days was always glad he did not come at hristmas now we are going to have just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather e shall enjoy him completely every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish here was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as r eston s confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter but not less to the purpose o know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make mma consider it so and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy t was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits he worn out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming and in the rapidity of half a moment s thought she hoped r lton would now be talked of no more r eston gave her the history of the engagements at nscombe which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command as well as the route and the method of his journey and she listened and smiled and congratulated shall soon bring him over to artfield said he at the conclusion mma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech from his wife e had better move on r eston said she we are detaining the girls ell well am ready and turning again to mma but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my account you know dare say he is really nothing extraordinary though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction mma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing hink of me to morrow my dear mma about four o clock was rs eston s parting injunction spoken with some anxiety and meant only for her our o clock depend upon it he will be here by three was r eston s quick amendment and so ended a most satisfactory meeting mma s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness every thing wore a different air ames and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before hen she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out and when she turned round to arriet she saw something like a look of spring a tender smile even there ill r rank hurchill pass through ath as well as xford was a question however which did not augur much ut neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once and mma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time he morning of the interesting day arrived and rs eston s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelve o clock that she was to think of her at four y dear dear anxious friend said she in mental soliloquy while walking downstairs from her own room always overcareful for every body s comfort but your own see you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right he clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall is twelve shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here am sure they will bring him soon he opened the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father r eston and his son hey had been arrived only a few minutes and r eston had scarcely finished his explanation of rank s being a day before his time and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations when she appeared to have her share of surprize introduction and pleasure he rank hurchill so long talked of so high in interest was actually before her he was presented to her and she did not think too much had been said in his praise he was a very good looking young man height air address all were unexceptionable and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father s he looked quick and sensible he felt immediately that she should like him and there was a well bred ease of manner and a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be e had reached andalls the evening before he was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan and travel earlier later and quicker that he might gain half a day told you yesterday cried r eston with exultation told you all that he would be here before the time named remembered what used to do myself ne cannot creep upon a journey one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out begins is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs t is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man though there are not many houses that should presume on so far but in coming home felt might do any thing he word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency mma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable the conviction was strengthened by what followed e was very much pleased with andalls thought it a most admirably arranged house would hardly allow it even to be very small admired the situation the walk to ighbury ighbury itself artfield still more and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one s own country gives and the greatest curiosity to visit it hat he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before passed suspiciously through mma s brain but still if it were a falsehood it was a pleasant one and pleasantly handled is manner had no air of study or exaggeration e did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment heir subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance n his side were the inquiries as she a horsewoman leasant rides leasant walks ad they a large neighbourhood ighbury perhaps afforded society enough here were several very pretty houses in and about it alls had they balls as it a musical society ut when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity while their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing his mother in law and speaking of her with so much handsome praise so much warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father and her very kind reception of himself as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her e did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by rs eston but undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter e understood what would be welcome he could be sure of little else is father s marriage he said had been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him e got as near as he could to thanking her for iss aylor s merits without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that iss aylor had formed iss oodhouse s character than iss oodhouse iss aylor s nd at last as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person legant agreeable manners was prepared for said he but confess that considering every thing had not expected more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age did not know that was to find a pretty young woman in rs eston ou cannot see too much perfection in rs eston for my feelings said mma were you to guess her to be eighteen should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words on t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman hope should know better he replied no depend upon it with a gallant bow that in addressing rs eston should understand whom might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms mma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other which had taken strong possession of her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance he must see more of him to understand his ways at present she only felt they were agreeable he had no doubt of what r eston was often thinking about is quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression and even when he might have determined not to look she was confident that he was often listening er own father s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion was a most comfortable circumstance appily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it hough always objecting to every marriage that was arranged he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them he blessed the favouring blindness e could now without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest give way to all his natural kind hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after r rank hurchill s accommodation on his journey through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold which however he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night reasonable visit paid r eston began to move e must be going e had business at the rown about his hay and a great many errands for rs eston at ord s but he need not hurry any body else is son too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also saying s you are going farther on business sir will take the opportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore may as well be paid now have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours turning to mma a lady residing in or near ighbury a family of the name of airfax shall have no difficulty suppose in finding the house though airfax believe is not the proper name should rather say arnes or ates o you know any family of that name o be sure we do cried his father rs ates we passed her house saw iss ates at the window rue true you are acquainted with iss airfax remember you knew her at eymouth and a fine girl she is all upon her by all means here is no necessity for my calling this morning said the young man another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at eymouth which h go to day go to day o not defer it hat is right to be done cannot be done too soon nd besides must give you a hint rank any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided ou saw her with the ampbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on f you do not call early it will be a slight he son looked convinced have heard her speak of the acquaintance said mma she is a very elegant young woman e agreed to it but with so quiet a es as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world if ane airfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it f you were never particularly struck by her manners before said she think you will to day ou will see her to advantage see her and hear her no am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue ou are acquainted with iss ane airfax sir are you said r oodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady he is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very worthy people have known them all my life hey will be extremely glad to see you am sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way y dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me ut your father is not going so far he is only going to the rown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street r rank hurchill still declined it looking as serious as he could and his father gave his hearty support by calling out y good friend this is quite unnecessary rank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to rs ates s he may get there from the rown in a hop step and jump hey were permitted to go alone and with a cordial nod from one and a graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave mma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance and could now engage to think of them all at andalls any hour of the day with full confidence in their comfort he next morning brought r rank hurchill again e came with rs eston to whom and to ighbury he seemed to take very cordially e had been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home till her usual hour of exercise and on being desired to chuse their walk immediately fixed on ighbury e did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him he should always chuse the same ighbury that airy cheerful happy looking ighbury would be his constant attraction ighbury with rs eston stood for artfield and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him hey walked thither directly mma had hardly expected them for r eston who had called in for half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome knew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize to her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together arm in arm he was wanting to see him again and especially to see him in company with rs eston upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend f he were deficient there nothing should make amends for it ut on seeing them together she became perfectly satisfied t was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection nd there was time enough for mma to form a reasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of the morning hey were all three walking about together for an hour or two first round the shrubberies of artfield and afterwards in ighbury e was delighted with every thing admired artfield sufficiently for r oodhouse s ear and when their going farther was resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than mma could have supposed ome of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings e begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long and which had been the home of his father s father and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit they shewed altogether a good will towards ighbury in general which must be very like a merit to those he was with mma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself that he had not been acting a part or making a parade of insincere professions and that r nightley certainly had not done him justice heir first pause was at the rown nn an inconsiderable house though the principal one of the sort where a couple of pair of post horses were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added it had been built many years ago for a ball room and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous dancing state had been occasionally used as such but such brilliant days had long passed away and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half gentlemen of the place e was immediately interested ts character as a ball room caught him and instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities and lament that its original purpose should have ceased e saw no fault in the room he would acknowledge none which they suggested o it was long enough broad enough handsome enough t would hold the very number for comfort hey ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter hy had not iss oodhouse revived the former good old days of the room he who could do any thing in ighbury he want of proper families in the place and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend were mentioned but he was not satisfied e could not be persuaded that so many good looking houses as he saw around him could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting and even when particulars were given and families described he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body s returning into their proper place the next morning e argued like a young man very much bent on dancing and mma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the eston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the hurchills e seemed to have all the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social inclinations of his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of nscombe f pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough his indifference to a confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind e could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap t was but an effusion of lively spirits t last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the rown and being now almost facing the house where the ateses lodged mma recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him if he had paid it es oh yes he replied was just going to mention it very successful visit saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint f the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me s it was was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit en minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and had told my father should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour he good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before nd how did you think iss airfax looking ll very ill that is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill ut the expression is hardly admissible rs eston is it adies can never look ill nd seriously iss airfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health most deplorable want of complexion mma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of iss airfax s complexion t was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face e listened with all due deference acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same but yet he must confess that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health here features were indifferent a fine complexion gave beauty to them all and where they were good the effect was fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was ell said mma there is no disputing about taste t least you admire her except her complexion e shook his head and laughed cannot separate iss airfax and her complexion id you see her often at eymouth ere you often in the same society t this moment they were approaching ord s and he hastily exclaimed a this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me e comes to ighbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at ord s f it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that may prove myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of ighbury must buy something at ord s t will be taking out my freedom dare say they sell gloves h yes gloves and every thing do admire your patriotism ou will be adored in ighbury ou were very popular before you came because you were r eston s son but lay out half a guinea at ord s and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues hey went in and while the sleek well tied parcels of en s eavers and ork an were bringing down and displaying on the counter he said ut beg your pardon iss oodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae o not let me lose it assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life merely asked whether you had known much of iss airfax and her party at eymouth nd now that understand your question must pronounce it to be a very unfair one t is always the lady s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance iss airfax must already have given her account shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow pon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself ut her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her ay indeed hen will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well met her frequently at eymouth had known the ampbells a little in town and at eymouth we were very much in the same set olonel ampbell is a very agreeable man and rs ampbell a friendly warm hearted woman like them all ou know iss airfax s situation in life conclude what she is destined to be es rather hesitatingly believe do ou get upon delicate subjects mma said rs eston smiling remember that am here r rank hurchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of iss airfax s situation in life will move a little farther off certainly do forget to think of her said mma as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend e looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment hen the gloves were bought and they had quitted the shop again id you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play said rank hurchill ver hear her repeated mma ou forget how much she belongs to ighbury have heard her every year of our lives since we both began he plays charmingly ou think so do you wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge he appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but know nothing of the matter myself am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body s performance have been used to hear her s admired and remember one proof of her being thought to play well a man a very musical man and in love with another woman engaged to her on the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other hat thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof roof indeed said mma highly amused r ixon is very musical is he e shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than iss airfax would have vouchsafed in half a year es r ixon and iss ampbell were the persons and thought it a very strong proof ertainly very strong it was to own the truth a great deal stronger than if had been iss ampbell would have been at all agreeable to me could not excuse a man s having more music than love more ear than eye a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings ow did iss ampbell appear to like it t was her very particular friend you know oor comfort said mma laughing ne would rather have a stranger preferred than one s very particular friend with a stranger it might not recur again but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself oor rs ixon ell am glad she is gone to settle in reland ou are right t was not very flattering to iss ampbell but she really did not seem to feel it o much the better or so much the worse do not know which ut be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her quickness of friendship or dulness of feeling there was one person think who must have felt it iss airfax herself he must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction s to that do not h do not imagine that expect an account of iss airfax s sensations from you or from any body else hey are known to no human being guess but herself ut if she continued to play whenever she was asked by r ixon one may guess what one chuses here appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all he began rather quickly but checking himself added however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were how it might all be behind the scenes can only say that there was smoothness outwardly ut you who have known iss airfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than can be have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends ut we never did hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set nd then her reserve never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved t is a most repulsive quality indeed said he ftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing here is safety in reserve but no attraction ne cannot love a reserved person ot till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction may be the greater ut must be more in want of a friend or an agreeable companion than have yet been to take the trouble of conquering any body s reserve to procure one ntimacy between iss airfax and me is quite out of the question have no reason to think ill of her not the least except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal e perfectly agreed with her and after walking together so long and thinking so much alike mma felt herself so well acquainted with him that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting e was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the world in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better than she had expected is ideas seemed more moderate his feelings warmer he was particularly struck by his manner of considering r lton s house which as well as the church he would go and look at and would not join them in finding much fault with o he could not believe it a bad house not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having f it were to be shared with the woman he loved he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house here must be ample room in it for every real comfort he man must be a blockhead who wanted more rs eston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about sed only to a large house himself and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one ut mma in her own mind determined that he did know what he was talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives e might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper s room or a bad butler s pantry but no doubt he did perfectly feel that nscombe could not make him happy and that whenever he were attached he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment mma s very good opinion of rank hurchill was a little shaken the following day by hearing that he was gone off to ondon merely to have his hair cut sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast and he had sent for a chaise and set off intending to return to dinner but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut here was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve t did not accord with the rationality of plan the moderation in expense or even the unselfish warmth of heart which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday anity extravagance love of change restlessness of temper which must be doing something good or bad heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and rs eston indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general he became liable to all these charges is father only called him a coxcomb and thought it a very good story but that rs eston did not like it was clear enough by her passing it over as quickly as possible and making no other comment than that all young people would have their little whims ith the exception of this little blot mma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him rs eston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether e appeared to have a very open temper certainly a very cheerful and lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notions a great deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of talking of him said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself and though there was no being attached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect his was all very promising and but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him the honour if not of being really in love with her of being at least very near it and saved only by her own indifference for still her resolution held of never marrying the honour in short of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance r eston on his side added a virtue to the account which must have some weight e gave her to understand that rank admired her extremely thought her very beautiful and very charming and with so much to be said for him altogether she found she must not judge him harshly s rs eston observed all young people would have their little whims here was one person among his new acquaintance in urry not so leniently disposed n general he was judged throughout the parishes of onwell and ighbury with great candour liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man one who smiled so often and bowed so well but there was one spirit among them not to be softened from its power of censure by bows or smiles r nightley he circumstance was told him at artfield for the moment he was silent but mma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself over a newspaper he held in his hand um just the trifling silly fellow took him for he had half a mind to resent but an instant s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings and not meant to provoke and therefore she let it pass lthough in one instance the bearers of not good tidings r and rs eston s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune omething occurred while they were at artfield to make mma want their advice and which was still more lucky she wanted exactly the advice they gave his was the occurrence he oles had been settled some years in ighbury and were very good sort of people friendly liberal and unpretending but on the other hand they were of low origin in trade and only moderately genteel n their first coming into the country they had lived in proportion to their income quietly keeping little company and that little unexpensively but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means the house in town had yielded greater profits and fortune in general had smiled on them ith their wealth their views increased their want of a larger house their inclination for more company hey added to their house to their number of servants to their expenses of every sort and by this time were in fortune and style of living second only to the family at artfield heir love of society and their new dining room prepared every body for their keeping dinner company and a few parties chiefly among the single men had already taken place he regular and best families mma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite neither onwell nor artfield nor andalls othing should tempt her to go if they did and she regretted that her father s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish he oles were very respectable in their way but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them his lesson she very much feared they would receive only from herself she had little hope of r nightley none of r eston ut she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared that when the insult came at last it found her very differently affected onwell and andalls had received their invitation and none had come for her father and herself and rs eston s accounting for it with suppose they will not take the liberty with you they know you do not dine out was not quite sufficient he felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal and afterwards as the idea of the party to be assembled there consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her occurred again and again she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept arriet was to be there in the evening and the ateses hey had been speaking of it as they walked about ighbury the day before and rank hurchill had most earnestly lamented her absence ight not the evening end in a dance had been a question of his he bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits and her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment was but poor comfort t was the arrival of this very invitation while the estons were at artfield which made their presence so acceptable for though her first remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful he owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely without inclination for the party he oles expressed themselves so properly there was so much real attention in the manner of it so much consideration for her father hey would have solicited the honour earlier but had been waiting the arrival of a folding screen from ondon which they hoped might keep r oodhouse from any draught of air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company pon the whole she was very persuadable and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort how certainly rs oddard if not rs ates might be depended on for bearing him company r oodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand and spending the whole evening away from him s for his going mma did not wish him to think it possible the hours would be too late and the party too numerous e was soon pretty well resigned am not fond of dinner visiting said he never was o more is mma ate hours do not agree with us am sorry r and rs ole should have done it think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with us take us in their afternoon walk which they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening he dews of a summer evening are what would not expose any body to owever as they are so very desirous to have dear mma dine with them and as you will both be there and r nightley too to take care of her cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy hen turning to rs eston with a look of gentle reproach h iss aylor if you had not married you would have staid at home with me ell sir cried r eston as took iss aylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if can and will step to rs oddard in a moment if you wish it ut the idea of any thing to be done in a moment was increasing not lessening r oodhouse s agitation he ladies knew better how to allay it r eston must be quiet and every thing deliberately arranged ith this treatment r oodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual e should be happy to see rs oddard e had a great regard for rs oddard and mma should write a line and invite her ames could take the note ut first of all there must be an answer written to rs ole ou will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible ou will say that am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline their obliging invitation beginning with my compliments of course ut you will do every thing right need not tell you what is to be done e must remember to let ames know that the carriage will be wanted on uesday shall have no fears for you with him e have never been there above once since the new approach was made but still have no doubt that ames will take you very safely nd when you get there you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again and you had better name an early hour ou will not like staying late ou will get very tired when tea is over ut you would not wish me to come away before am tired papa h no my love but you will soon be tired here will be a great many people talking at once ou will not like the noise ut my dear sir cried r eston if mma comes away early it will be breaking up the party nd no great harm if it does said r oodhouse he sooner every party breaks up the better ut you do not consider how it may appear to the oles mma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence hey are good natured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no great compliment and iss oodhouse s doing it would be more thought of than any other person s in the room ou would not wish to disappoint and mortify the oles am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years o upon no account in the world r eston am much obliged to you for reminding me should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain know what worthy people they are erry tells me that r ole never touches malt liquor ou would not think it to look at him but he is bilious r ole is very bilious o would not be the means of giving them any pain y dear mma we must consider this am sure rather than run the risk of hurting r and rs ole you would stay a little longer than you might wish ou will not regard being tired ou will be perfectly safe you know among your friends h yes papa have no fears at all for myself and should have no scruples of staying as late as rs eston but on your account am only afraid of your sitting up for me am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with rs oddard he loves piquet you know but when she is gone home am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual time and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort ou must promise me not to sit up e did on the condition of some promises on her side such as that if she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly if hungry that she would take something to eat that her own maid should sit up for her and that erle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house as usual rank hurchill came back again and if he kept his father s dinner waiting it was not known at artfield for rs eston was too anxious for his being a favourite with r oodhouse to betray any imperfection which could be concealed e came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself with a very good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done e had no reason to wish his hair longer to conceal any confusion of face no reason to wish the money unspent to improve his spirits e was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever and after seeing him mma thus moralised to herself do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way ickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly t depends upon the character of those who handle it r nightley he is not a trifling silly young man f he were he would have done this differently e would either have gloried in the achievement or been ashamed of it here would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities o am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly ith uesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again and for a longer time than hitherto of judging of his general manners and by inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air and of fancying what the observations of all those might be who were now seeing them together for the first time he meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at r ole s and without being able to forget that among the failings of r lton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with r ole er father s comfort was amply secured rs ates as well as rs oddard being able to come and her last pleasing duty before she left the house was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress to make the two ladies all the amends in her power by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine for whatever unwilling self denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal he had provided a plentiful dinner for them she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it he followed another carriage to r ole s door and was pleased to see that it was r nightley s for r nightley keeping no horses having little spare money and a great deal of health activity and independence was too apt in mma s opinion to get about as he could and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of onwell bbey he had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out his is coming as you should do said she like a gentleman am quite glad to see you e thanked her observing ow lucky that we should arrive at the same moment for if we had met first in the drawing room doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual ou might not have distinguished how came by my look or manner es should am sure should here is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them ou think you carry it off very well dare say but with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern always observe it whenever meet you under those circumstances ow you have nothing to try for ou are not afraid of being supposed ashamed ou are not striving to look taller than any body else ow shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you onsensical girl was his reply but not at all in anger mma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with r nightley he was received with a cordial respect which could not but please and given all the consequence she could wish for hen the estons arrived the kindest looks of love the strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated by her and as she firmly believed not without some dexterity on his side he party was rather large as it included one other family a proper unobjectionable country family whom the oles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance and the male part of r ox s family the lawyer of ighbury he less worthy females were to come in the evening with iss ates iss airfax and iss mith but already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general and while politics and r lton were talked over mma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour he first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend was the name of ane airfax rs ole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting he listened and found it well worth listening to hat very dear part of mma her fancy received an amusing supply rs ole was telling that she had been calling on iss ates and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte a very elegant looking instrument not a grand but a large sized square pianoforte and the substance of the story the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize and inquiry and congratulations on her side and explanations on iss ates s was that this pianoforte had arrived from roadwood s the day before to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece entirely unexpected that at first by iss ates s account ane herself was quite at a loss quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it but now they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter of course it must be from olonel ampbell ne can suppose nothing else added rs ole and was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt ut ane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it he knows their ways best but should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present hey might chuse to surprize her rs ole had many to agree with her every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from olonel ampbell and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made and there were enough ready to speak to allow mma to think her own way and still listen to rs ole declare do not know when have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction t always has quite hurt me that ane airfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument t seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away his is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was but yesterday was telling r ole really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room while do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor ane airfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with was saying this to r ole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought or else am sure we ought to be ashamed of it e are in great hopes that iss oodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening iss oodhouse made the proper acquiescence and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of rs ole s turned to rank hurchill hy do you smile said she ay why do you e suppose smile for pleasure at olonel ampbell s being so rich and so liberal t is a handsome present ery rather wonder that it was never made before erhaps iss airfax has never been staying here so long before r that he did not give her the use of their own instrument which must now be shut up in ondon untouched by any body hat is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for rs ates s house ou may say what you chuse but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine do not know rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than deserve smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever find you suspect but at present do not see what there is to question f olonel ampbell is not the person who can be hat do you say to rs ixon rs ixon very true indeed had not thought of rs ixon he must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young woman s scheme than an elderly man s t is rs ixon dare say told you that your suspicions would guide mine f so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend r ixon in them r ixon ery well es immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of r and rs ixon e were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance es and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which had entertained before do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either r ixon or iss airfax but cannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side ne might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to ighbury instead of going with the ampbells to reland ere she must be leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment s to the pretence of trying her native air look upon that as a mere excuse n the summer it might have passed but what can any body s native air do for them in the months of anuary ebruary and arch ood fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and dare say in her s do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so noble a profession of doing it but honestly tell you what they are nd upon my word they have an air of great probability r ixon s preference of her music to her friend s can answer for being very decided nd then he saved her life id you ever hear of that water party and by some accident she was falling overboard e caught her e did was there one of the party ere you really ell ut you observed nothing of course for it seems to be a new idea to you f had been there think should have made some discoveries dare say you would but simple saw nothing but the fact that iss airfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that r ixon caught her t was the work of a moment nd though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable indeed believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries he conversation was here interrupted hey were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others but when the table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed exactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored mma said he arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me wanted to know a little more and this tells me quite enough epend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from r and rs ixon nd if the ixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the ampbells o am sure it is not from the ampbells iss airfax knows it is not from the ampbells or they would have been guessed at first he would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them may not have convinced you perhaps but am perfectly convinced myself that r ixon is a principal in the business ndeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced our reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely t first while supposed you satisfied that olonel ampbell was the giver saw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world ut when you mentioned rs ixon felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship nd now can see it in no other light than as an offering of love here was no occasion to press the matter farther he conviction seemed real he looked as if he felt it he said no more other subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away the dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation a few clever things said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other nothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news and heavy jokes he ladies had not been long in the drawing room before the other ladies in their different divisions arrived mma watched the entree of her own particular little friend and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light cheerful unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection here she sat and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding o be in company nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty and say nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour ane airfax did look and move superior but mma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with arriet very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved yes of having loved even r lton in vain by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend n so large a party it was not necessary that mma should approach her he did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much in the secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair and therefore purposely kept at a distance but by the others the subject was almost immediately introduced and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my excellent friend olonel ampbell rs eston kind hearted and musical was particularly interested by the circumstance and mma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject and having so much to ask and to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible which she plainly read in the fair heroine s countenance hey were soon joined by some of the gentlemen and the very first of the early was rank hurchill n he walked the first and the handsomest and after paying his compliments en passant to iss ates and her niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle where sat iss oodhouse and till he could find a seat by her would not sit at all mma divined what every body present must be thinking he was his object and every body must perceive it he introduced him to her friend iss mith and at convenient moments afterwards heard what each thought of the other e had never seen so lovely a face and was delighted with her naivete nd she nly to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment but she did think there were some looks a little like r lton mma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence miles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards iss airfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech e told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining room hated sitting long was always the first to move when he could that his father r nightley r ox and r ole were left very busy over parish business that as long as he had staid however it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of ighbury altogether thought it so abundant in agreeable families that mma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much he questioned him as to the society in orkshire the extent of the neighbourhood about nscombe and the sort and could make out from his answers that as far as nscombe was concerned there was very little going on that their visitings were among a range of great families none very near and that even when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even chance that rs hurchill were not in health and spirits for going that they made a point of visiting no fresh person and that though he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without considerable address at times that he could get away or introduce an acquaintance for a night he saw that nscombe could not satisfy and that ighbury taken at its best might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked is importance at nscombe was very evident e did not boast but it naturally betrayed itself that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing and on her laughing and noticing it he owned that he believed excepting one or two points he could with time persuade her to any thing ne of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned e had wanted very much to go abroad had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel but she would not hear of it his had happened the year before ow he said he was beginning to have no longer the same wish he unpersuadable point which he did not mention mma guessed to be good behaviour to his father have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause have been here a week to morrow half my time never knew days fly so fast week to morrow nd have hardly begun to enjoy myself ut just got acquainted with rs eston and others hate the recollection erhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut o said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless can believe myself fit to be seen he rest of the gentlemen being now in the room mma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to r ole hen r ole had moved away and her attention could be restored as before she saw rank hurchill looking intently across the room at iss airfax who was sitting exactly opposite hat is the matter said she e started hank you for rousing me he replied believe have been very rude but really iss airfax has done her hair in so odd a way so very odd a way that cannot keep my eyes from her never saw any thing so outree hose curls his must be a fancy of her own see nobody else looking like her must go and ask her whether it is an rish fashion hall es will declare will and you shall see how she takes it whether she colours e was gone immediately and mma soon saw him standing before iss airfax and talking to her but as to its effect on the young lady as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly in front of iss airfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing efore he could return to his chair it was taken by rs eston his is the luxury of a large party said she one can get near every body and say every thing y dear mma am longing to talk to you have been making discoveries and forming plans just like yourself and must tell them while the idea is fresh o you know how iss ates and her niece came here ow hey were invited were not they h yes but how they were conveyed hither the manner of their coming hey walked conclude ow else could they come ery true ell a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have ane airfax walking home again late at night and cold as the nights are now nd as looked at her though never saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold oor girl could not bear the idea of it so as soon as r eston came into the room and could get at him spoke to him about the carriage ou may guess how readily he came into my wishes and having his approbation made my way directly to iss ates to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home for thought it would be making her comfortable at once ood soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure obody was ever so fortunate as herself but with many many thanks there was no occasion to trouble us for r nightley s carriage had brought and was to take them home again was quite surprized very glad am sure but really quite surprized uch a very kind attention and so thoughtful an attention the sort of thing that so few men would think of nd in short from knowing his usual ways am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them ery likely said mma nothing more likely know no man more likely than r nightley to do the sort of thing to do any thing really good natured useful considerate or benevolent e is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering ane airfax s ill health would appear a case of humanity to him and for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom would fix on more than on r nightley know he had horses to day for we arrived together and laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray ell said rs eston smiling you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than do for while iss ates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and have never been able to get it out again he more think of it the more probable it appears n short have made a match between r nightley and ane airfax ee the consequence of keeping you company hat do you say to it r nightley and ane airfax exclaimed mma ear rs eston how could you think of such a thing r nightley r nightley must not marry ou would not have little enry cut out from onwell h no no enry must have onwell cannot at all consent to r nightley s marrying and am sure it is not at all likely am amazed that you should think of such a thing y dear mma have told you what led me to think of it do not want the match do not want to injure dear little enry but the idea has been given me by circumstances and if r nightley really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on enry s account a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter es would could not bear to have enry supplanted r nightley marry o have never had such an idea and cannot adopt it now nd ane airfax too of all women ay she has always been a first favourite with him as you very well know ut the imprudence of such a match am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention is good nature his humanity as tell you would be quite enough to account for the horses e has a great regard for the ateses you know independent of ane airfax and is always glad to shew them attention y dear rs eston do not take to match making ou do it very ill ane airfax mistress of the bbey h no no every feeling revolts or his own sake would not have him do so mad a thing mprudent if you please but not mad xcepting inequality of fortune and perhaps a little disparity of age can see nothing unsuitable ut r nightley does not want to marry am sure he has not the least idea of it o not put it into his head hy should he marry e is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely fond of his brother s children e has no occasion to marry either to fill up his time or his heart y dear mma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves ane airfax onsense e does not care about ane airfax n the way of love am sure he does not e would do any good to her or her family but ell said rs eston laughing perhaps the greatest good he could do them would be to give ane such a respectable home f it would be good to her am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion ow would he bear to have iss ates belonging to him o have her haunting the bbey and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying ane o very kind and obliging ut he always had been such a very kind neighbour nd then fly off through half a sentence to her mother s old petticoat ot that it was such a very old petticoat either for still it would last a great while and indeed she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong or shame mma o not mimic her ou divert me against my conscience nd upon my word do not think r nightley would be much disturbed by iss ates ittle things do not irritate him he might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and drown her voice ut the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it and think he does have heard him speak and so must you so very highly of ane airfax he interest he takes in her his anxiety about her health his concern that she should have no happier prospect have heard him express himself so warmly on those points uch an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte and of her voice have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever h and had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the ampbells may it not be from r nightley cannot help suspecting him think he is just the person to do it even without being in love hen it can be no argument to prove that he is in love ut do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do r nightley does nothing mysteriously have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly oftener than should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of things occur to him ery well and if he had intended to give her one he would have told her so here might be scruples of delicacy my dear mma have a very strong notion that it comes from him am sure he was particularly silent when rs ole told us of it at dinner ou take up an idea rs eston and run away with it as you have many a time reproached me with doing see no sign of attachment believe nothing of the pianoforte and proof only shall convince me that r nightley has any thought of marrying ane airfax hey combated the point some time longer in the same way mma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend for rs eston was the most used of the two to yield till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over and the instrument in preparation and at the same moment r ole approaching to entreat iss oodhouse would do them the honour of trying it rank hurchill of whom in the eagerness of her conversation with rs eston she had been seeing nothing except that he had found a seat by iss airfax followed r ole to add his very pressing entreaties and as in every respect it suited mma best to lead she gave a very proper compliance he knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable and could accompany her own voice well ne accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize a second slightly but correctly taken by rank hurchill er pardon was duly begged at the close of the song and every thing usual followed e was accused of having a delightful voice and a perfect knowledge of music which was properly denied and that he knew nothing of the matter and had no voice at all roundly asserted hey sang together once more and mma would then resign her place to iss airfax whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own ith mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument to listen rank hurchill sang again hey had sung together once or twice it appeared at eymouth ut the sight of r nightley among the most attentive soon drew away half mma s mind and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of rs eston s suspicions to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions er objections to r nightley s marrying did not in the least subside he could see nothing but evil in it t would be a great disappointment to r ohn nightley consequently to sabella real injury to the children a most mortifying change and material loss to them all a very great deduction from her father s daily comfort and as to herself she could not at all endure the idea of ane airfax at onwell bbey rs nightley for them all to give way to o r nightley must never marry ittle enry must remain the heir of onwell resently r nightley looked back and came and sat down by her hey talked at first only of the performance is admiration was certainly very warm yet she thought but for rs eston it would not have struck her s a sort of touchstone however she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own often feel concern said she that dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions t is not that am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that ames should put to for such a purpose uite out of the question quite out of the question he replied but you must often wish it am sure nd he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step his present from the ampbells said she this pianoforte is very kindly given es he replied and without the smallest apparent embarrassment ut they would have done better had they given her notice of it urprizes are foolish things he pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable should have expected better judgment in olonel ampbell rom that moment mma could have taken her oath that r nightley had had no concern in giving the instrument ut whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment whether there were no actual preference remained a little longer doubtful owards the end of ane s second song her voice grew thick hat will do said he when it was finished thinking aloud you have sung quite enough for one evening now be quiet nother song however was soon begged for ne more they would not fatigue iss airfax on any account and would only ask for one more nd rank hurchill was heard to say think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling he strength of the song falls on the second r nightley grew angry hat fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice his must not be nd touching iss ates who at that moment passed near iss ates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner o and interfere hey have no mercy on her iss ates in her real anxiety for ane could hardly stay even to be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing ere ceased the concert part of the evening for iss oodhouse and iss airfax were the only young lady performers but soon within five minutes the proposal of dancing originating nobody exactly knew where was so effectually promoted by r and rs ole that every thing was rapidly clearing away to give proper space rs eston capital in her country dances was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and rank hurchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to mma had secured her hand and led her up to the top hile waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off mma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste to look about and see what became of r nightley his would be a trial e was no dancer in general f he were to be very alert in engaging ane airfax now it might augur something here was no immediate appearance o he was talking to rs ole he was looking on unconcerned ane was asked by somebody else and he was still talking to rs ole mma had no longer an alarm for enry his interest was yet safe and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment ot more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well matched in a partner hey were a couple worth looking at wo dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed t was growing late and iss ates became anxious to get home on her mother s account fter some attempts therefore to be permitted to begin again they were obliged to thank rs eston look sorrowful and have done erhaps it is as well said rank hurchill as he attended mma to her carriage must have asked iss airfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after your s mma did not repent her condescension in going to the oles he visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity he must have delighted the oles worthy people who deserved to be made happy nd left a name behind her that would not soon die away erfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were two points on which she was not quite easy he doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying her suspicions of ane airfax s feelings to rank hurchill t was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it would escape her and his submission to all that she told was a compliment to her penetration which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue he other circumstance of regret related also to ane airfax and there she had no doubt he did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing he did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half he was then interrupted by arriet s coming in and if arriet s praise could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted h if could but play as well as you and iss airfax on t class us together arriet y playing is no more like her s than a lamp is like sunshine h dear think you play the best of the two think you play quite as well as she does am sure had much rather hear you very body last night said how well you played hose who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference he truth is arriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised but ane airfax s is much beyond it ell always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out r ole said how much taste you had and r rank hurchill talked a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution h but ane airfax has them both arriet re you sure saw she had execution but did not know she had any taste obody talked about it nd hate talian singing here is no understanding a word of it esides if she does play so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach he oxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family ow did you think the oxes looked ust as they always do very vulgar hey told me something said arriet rather hesitatingly but it is nothing of any consequence mma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful of its producing r lton hey told me that r artin dined with them last aturday h e came to their father upon some business and he asked him to stay to dinner h hey talked a great deal about him especially nne ox do not know what she meant but she asked me if thought should go and stay there again next summer he meant to be impertinently curious just as such an nne ox should be he said he was very agreeable the day he dined there e sat by her at dinner iss ash thinks either of the oxes would be very glad to marry him ery likely think they are without exception the most vulgar girls in ighbury arriet had business at ord s mma thought it most prudent to go with her nother accidental meeting with the artins was possible and in her present state would be dangerous arriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always very long at a purchase and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind mma went to the door for amusement uch could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of ighbury r erry walking hastily by r illiam ox letting himself in at the office door r ole s carriage horses returning from exercise or a stray letter boy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone and a string of dawdling children round the baker s little bow window eyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain and was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing and can see nothing that does not answer he looked down the andalls road he scene enlarged two persons appeared rs eston and her son in law they were walking into ighbury to artfield of course hey were stopping however in the first place at rs ates s whose house was a little nearer andalls than ord s and had all but knocked when mma caught their eye mmediately they crossed the road and came forward to her and the agreeableness of yesterday s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting rs eston informed her that she was going to call on the ateses in order to hear the new instrument or my companion tells me said she that absolutely promised iss ates last night that would come this morning was not aware of it myself did not know that had fixed a day but as he says did am going now nd while rs eston pays her visit may be allowed hope said rank hurchill to join your party and wait for her at artfield if you are going home rs eston was disappointed thought you meant to go with me hey would be very much pleased e should be quite in the way ut perhaps may be equally in the way here iss oodhouse looks as if she did not want me y aunt always sends me off when she is shopping he says fidget her to death and iss oodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same hat am to do am here on no business of my own said mma am only waiting for my friend he will probably have soon done and then we shall go home ut you had better go with rs eston and hear the instrument ell if you advise it ut with a smile if olonel ampbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall say shall be no support to rs eston he might do very well by herself disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood do not believe any such thing replied mma am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent uite otherwise indeed if understood iss airfax s opinion last night o come with me said rs eston if it be not very disagreeable to you t need not detain us long e will go to artfield afterwards e will follow them to artfield really wish you to call with me t will be felt so great an attention and always thought you meant it e could say no more and with the hope of artfield to reward him returned with rs eston to rs ates s door mma watched them in and then joined arriet at the interesting counter trying with all the force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured and that a blue ribbon be it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern t last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel hould send it to rs oddard s ma am asked rs ord es no yes to rs oddard s nly my pattern gown is at artfield o you shall send it to artfield if you please ut then rs oddard will want to see it nd could take the pattern gown home any day ut shall want the ribbon directly so it had better go to artfield at least the ribbon ou could make it into two parcels rs ord could not you t is not worth while arriet to give rs ord the trouble of two parcels o more it is o trouble in the world ma am said the obliging rs ord h but indeed would much rather have it only in one hen if you please you shall send it all to rs oddard s do not know o think iss oodhouse may just as well have it sent to artfield and take it home with me at night hat do you advise hat you do not give another half second to the subject o artfield if you please rs ord ye that will be much best said arriet quite satisfied should not at all like to have it sent to rs oddard s oices approached the shop or rather one voice and two ladies rs eston and iss ates met them at the door y dear iss oodhouse said the latter am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while and give us your opinion of our new instrument you and iss mith ow do you do iss mith ery well thank you nd begged rs eston to come with me that might be sure of succeeding hope rs ates and iss airfax are ery well am much obliged to you y mother is delightfully well and ane caught no cold last night ow is r oodhouse am so glad to hear such a good account rs eston told me you were here h then said must run across am sure iss oodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in my mother will be so very happy to see her and now we are such a nice party she cannot refuse ye pray do said r rank hurchill iss oodhouse s opinion of the instrument will be worth having ut said shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me h said he wait half a minute till have finished my job or would you believe it iss oodhouse there he is in the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my mother s spectacles he rivet came out you know this morning o very obliging or my mother had no use of her spectacles could not put them on nd by the bye every body ought to have two pair of spectacles they should indeed ane said so meant to take them over to ohn aunders the first thing did but something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing then another there is no saying what you know t one time atty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping h said atty do not come with your bad news to me ere is the rivet of your mistress s spectacles out hen the baked apples came home rs allis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and obliging to us the allises always have heard some people say that rs allis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them nd it cannot be for the value of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know nly three of us besides dear ane at present and she really eats nothing makes such a shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it dare not let my mother know how little she eats so say one thing and then say another and it passes off ut about the middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for took the opportunity the other day of asking r erry happened to meet him in the street ot that had any doubt before have so often heard r oodhouse recommend a baked apple believe it is the only way that r oodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome e have apple dumplings however very often atty makes an excellent apple dumpling ell rs eston you have prevailed hope and these ladies will oblige us mma would be very happy to wait on rs ates c and they did at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from iss ates than ow do you do rs ord beg your pardon did not see you before hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town ane came back delighted yesterday hank ye the gloves do very well only a little too large about the wrist but ane is taking them in hat was talking of said she beginning again when they were all in the street mma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix declare cannot recollect what was talking of h my mother s spectacles o very obliging of r rank hurchill h said he do think can fasten the rivet like a job of this kind excessively hich you know shewed him to be so very ndeed must say that much as had heard of him before and much as had expected he very far exceeds any thing do congratulate you rs eston most warmly e seems every thing the fondest parent could h said he can fasten the rivet like a job of that sort excessively never shall forget his manner nd when brought out the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some h said he directly there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good and these are the finest looking home baked apples ever saw in my life hat you know was so very nd am sure by his manner it was no compliment ndeed they are very delightful apples and rs allis does them full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice and r oodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but iss oodhouse will be so good as not to mention it he apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt all from onwell some of r nightley s most liberal supply e sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees believe there is two of them y mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days ut was really quite shocked the other day for r nightley called one morning and ane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock am sure you must be said he and will send you another supply for have a great many more than can ever use illiam arkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year will send you some more before they get good for nothing o begged he would not for really as to ours being gone could not absolutely say that we had a great many left it was but half a dozen indeed but they should be all kept for ane and could not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he had been already and ane said the same nd when he was gone she almost quarrelled with me o should not say quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed that had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished had made him believe we had a great many left h said my dear did say as much as could owever the very same evening illiam arkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of apples a bushel at least and was very much obliged and went down and spoke to illiam arkins and said every thing as you may suppose illiam arkins is such an old acquaintance am always glad to see him ut however found afterwards from atty that illiam said it was all the apples of that sort his master had he had brought them all and now his master had not one left to bake or boil illiam did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for illiam you know thinks more of his master s profit than any thing but rs odges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away he could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple tart this spring e told atty this but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for rs odges would be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder nd so atty told me and was excessively shocked indeed would not have r nightley know any thing about it for the world e would be so very wanted to keep it from ane s knowledge but unluckily had mentioned it before was aware iss ates had just done as atty opened the door and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good will ray take care rs eston there is a step at the turning ray take care iss oodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase rather darker and narrower than one could wish iss mith pray take care iss oodhouse am quite concerned am sure you hit your foot iss mith the step at the turning he appearance of the little sitting room as they entered was tranquillity itself rs ates deprived of her usual employment slumbering on one side of the fire rank hurchill at a table near her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and ane airfax standing with her back to them intent on her pianoforte usy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing mma again his is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at least ten minutes earlier than had calculated ou find me trying to be useful tell me if you think shall succeed hat said rs eston have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate have not been working uninterruptedly he replied have been assisting iss airfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor believe ou see we have been wedging one leg with paper his was very kind of you to be persuaded to come was almost afraid you would be hurrying home e contrived that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying to make her help or advise him in his work till ane airfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again hat she was not immediately ready mma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance and mma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again t last ane began and though the first bars were feebly given the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to rs eston had been delighted before and was delighted again mma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every proper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise hoever olonel ampbell might employ said rank hurchill with a smile at mma the person has not chosen ill heard a good deal of olonel ampbell s taste at eymouth and the softness of the upper notes am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize dare say iss airfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to roadwood himself o not you think so ane did not look round he was not obliged to hear rs eston had been speaking to her at the same moment t is not fair said mma in a whisper mine was a random guess o not distress her e shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy oon afterwards he began again ow much your friends in reland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion iss airfax dare say they often think of you and wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instrument s coming to hand o you imagine olonel ampbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time o you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon contingencies and conveniences e paused he could not but hear she could not avoid answering ill have a letter from olonel ampbell said she in a voice of forced calmness can imagine nothing with any confidence t must be all conjecture onjecture aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong wish could conjecture how soon shall make this rivet quite firm hat nonsense one talks iss oodhouse when hard at work if one talks at all your real workmen suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word iss airfax said something about conjecturing here it is done have the pleasure madam to rs ates of restoring your spectacles healed for the present e was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escape a little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged iss airfax who was still sitting at it to play something more f you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night let me live them over again ou did not enjoy them as did you appeared tired the whole time believe you were glad we danced no longer but would have given worlds all the worlds one ever has to give for another half hour he played hat felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy f mistake not that was danced at eymouth he looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played something else e took some music from a chair near the pianoforte and turning to mma said ere is something quite new to me o you know it ramer nd here are a new set of rish melodies hat from such a quarter one might expect his was all sent with the instrument ery thoughtful of olonel ampbell was not it e knew iss airfax could have no music here honour that part of the attention particularly it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart othing hastily done nothing incomplete rue affection only could have prompted it mma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused and when on glancing her eye towards ane airfax she caught the remains of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight she had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction with respect to her his amiable upright perfect ane airfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings e brought all the music to her and they looked it over together mma took the opportunity of whispering ou speak too plain he must understand you hope she does would have her understand me am not in the least ashamed of my meaning ut really am half ashamed and wish had never taken up the idea am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me have now a key to all her odd looks and ways eave shame to her f she does wrong she ought to feel it he is not entirely without it think do not see much sign of it he is playing obin dair at this moment his favourite hortly afterwards iss ates passing near the window descried r nightley on horse back not far off r nightley declare must speak to him if possible just to thank him will not open the window here it would give you all cold but can go into my mother s room you know dare say he will come in when he knows who is here uite delightful to have you all meet so ur little room so honoured he was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the casement there immediately called r nightley s attention and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as if it had passed within the same apartment ow d ye do how d ye do ery well thank you o obliged to you for the carriage last night e were just in time my mother just ready for us ray come in do come in ou will find some friends here o began iss ates and r nightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn for most resolutely and commandingly did he say ow is your niece iss ates want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece ow is iss airfax hope she caught no cold last night ow is she to day ell me how iss airfax is nd iss ates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in

carriage resumed iss ates e cut her short with am going to ingston an do any thing for you h dear ingston are you rs ole was saying the other day she wanted something from ingston rs ole has servants

for suppose iss oodhouse and r rank hurchill are hearing every thing that passes nd raising his voice still more do not see why iss airfax should not be mentioned too think iss airfax dances very well and rs eston is the very best country dance player without exception in ngland ow if your friends have any gratitude they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return but cannot stay to hear it h r nightley one moment more something of consequence so shocked ane and are both so shocked about the apples hat is the matter now o think of your sending us all your store apples ou said you had a great many and now you have not one left e really are so shocked rs odges may well be angry illiam arkins mentioned it here ou should not have done it indeed you should not h he is off e never can bear to be thanked ut thought he would have staid now and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned ell returning to the room have not been able to succeed r nightley cannot stop e is going to ingston e asked me if he could do any thing es said ane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing h yes my dear dare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and r nightley spoke loud ou must have heard every thing to be sure an do any thing for you at ingston said he so just mentioned h iss oodhouse must you be going ou seem but just come so very obliging of you mma found it really time to be at home the visit had already lasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived to be gone that rs eston and her companion taking leave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to artfield gates before they set off for andalls t may be possible to do without dancing entirely nstances have been known of young people passing many many months successively without being at any ball of any description and no material injury accrue either to body or mind but when a beginning is made when the felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly felt it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more rank hurchill had danced once at ighbury and longed to dance again and the last half hour of an evening which r oodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at andalls was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject rank s was the first idea and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance ut still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully r rank hurchill and iss oodhouse danced for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with ane airfax and even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked aids of vanity to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that r eston could say of their exactly equal size that it was a little the largest is first proposition and request that the dance begun at r ole s should be finished there that the same party should be collected and the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence r eston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment and rs eston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance and the interesting employment had followed of reckoning up exactly who there would be and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple ou and iss mith and iss airfax will be three and the two iss oxes five had been repeated many times over nd there will be the two ilberts young ox my father and myself besides r nightley es that will be quite enough for pleasure ou and iss mith and iss airfax will be three and the two iss oxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room ut soon it came to be on one side ut will there be good room for five couple really do not think there will n another nd after all five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up ive couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it t will not do to invite five couple t can be allowable only as the thought of the moment omebody said that iss ilbert was expected at her brother s and must be invited with the rest omebody else believed rs ilbert would have danced the other evening if she had been asked word was put in for a second young ox and at last r eston naming one family of cousins who must be included and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of he doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other ight not they use both rooms and dance across the passage t seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better mma said it would be awkward rs eston was in distress about the supper and r oodhouse opposed it earnestly on the score of health t made him so very unhappy indeed that it could not be persevered in h no said he it would be the extreme of imprudence could not bear it for mma mma is not strong he would catch a dreadful cold o would poor little arriet o you would all rs eston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing ray do not let them talk of it hat young man speaking lower is very thoughtless o not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing e has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately e does not think of the draught do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing rs eston was sorry for such a charge he knew the importance of it and said every thing in her power to do it away very door was now closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again and with such good will on rank hurchill s part that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten e were too magnificent said he e allowed unnecessary room en couple may stand here very well mma demurred t would be a crowd a sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ery true he gravely replied it was very bad ut still he went on measuring and still he ended with think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple o no said she you are quite unreasonable t would be dreadful to be standing so close othing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd and a crowd in a little room here is no denying it he replied agree with you exactly crowd in a little room iss oodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words xquisite quite exquisite till however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up t would be a disappointment to my father and altogether do not know that am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well mma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self willed and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave the rest ad she intended ever to marry him it might have been worth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value of his preference and the character of his temper but for all the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite amiable enough efore the middle of the next day he was at artfield and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme t soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement ell iss oodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away hope by the terrors of my father s little rooms bring a new proposal on the subject a thought of my father s which waits only your approbation to be acted upon ay hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at andalls but at the rown nn he rown es if you and r oodhouse see no objection and trust you cannot my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there etter accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at andalls t is his own idea rs eston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied his is what we all feel h you were perfectly right en couple in either of the andalls rooms would have been insufferable readful felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield s not it a good exchange ou consent hope you consent t appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if r and rs eston do not think it admirable and as far as can answer for myself shall be most happy t seems the only improvement that could be apa do you not think it an excellent improvement he was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully comprehended and then being quite new farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable o he thought it very far from an improvement a very bad plan much worse than the other room at an inn was always damp and dangerous never properly aired or fit to be inhabited f they must dance they had better dance at andalls e had never been in the room at the rown in his life did not know the people who kept it by sight h no a very bad plan hey would catch worse colds at the rown than anywhere was going to observe sir said rank hurchill that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body s catching cold so much less danger at the rown than at andalls r erry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could ir said r oodhouse rather warmly you are very much mistaken if you suppose r erry to be that sort of character r erry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill ut do not understand how the room at the rown can be safer for you than your father s house rom the very circumstance of its being larger sir e shall have no occasion to open the windows at all not once the whole evening and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief pen the windows but surely r hurchill nobody would think of opening the windows at andalls obody could be so imprudent never heard of such a thing ancing with open windows am sure neither your father nor rs eston poor iss aylor that was would suffer it h sir but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window curtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected have often known it done myself ave you indeed sir less me never could have supposed it ut live out of the world and am often astonished at what hear owever this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration ne cannot resolve upon them in a hurry f r and rs eston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done ut unfortunately sir my time is so limited h interrupted mma there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over here is no hurry at all f it can be contrived to be at the rown papa it will be very convenient for the horses hey will be so near their own stable o they will my dear hat is a great thing ot that ames ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can f could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is rs tokes to be trusted doubt it do not know her even by sight can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under rs eston s care rs eston undertakes to direct the whole here papa ow you must be satisfied ur own dear rs eston who is carefulness itself o not you remember what r erry said so many years ago when had the measles f iss aylor undertakes to wrap iss mma up you need not have any fears sir ow often have heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ye very true r erry did say so shall never forget it oor little mma ou were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for erry s great attention e came four times a day for a week e said from the first it was a very good sort which was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint hope whenever poor sabella s little ones have the measles she will send for erry y father and rs eston are at the rown at this moment said rank hurchill examining the capabilities of the house left them there and came on to artfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot was desired to say so from both t would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there hey can do nothing satisfactorily without you mma was most happy to be called to such a council and her father engaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young people set off together without delay for the rown here were r and rs eston delighted to see her and receive her approbation very busy and very happy in their different way she in some little distress and he finding every thing perfect mma said she this paper is worse than expected ook in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing could have imagined y dear you are too particular said her husband hat does all that signify ou will see nothing of it by candlelight t will be as clean as andalls by candlelight e never see any thing of it on our club nights he ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant en never know when things are dirty or not and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself omen will have their little nonsenses and needless cares ne perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain t regarded a supper room t the time of the ballroom s being built suppers had not been in question and a small card room adjoining was the only addition hat was to be done his card room would be wanted as a card room now or if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves still was it not too small for any comfortable supper nother room of much better size might be secured for the purpose but it was at the other end of the house and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it his made a difficulty rs eston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage and neither mma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper rs eston proposed having no regular supper merely sandwiches c set out in the little room but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion private dance without sitting down to supper was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women and rs eston must not speak of it again he then took another line of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed do not think it is so very small e shall not be many you know nd r eston at the same time walking briskly with long steps through the passage was calling out ou talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear t is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs wish said rs eston one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best o do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object if one could but tell what that would be es very true cried rank very true ou want your neighbours opinions do not wonder at you f one could ascertain what the chief of them the oles for instance hey are not far off hall call upon them r iss ates he is still nearer nd do not know whether iss ates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body think we do want a larger council uppose go and invite iss ates to join us ell if you please said rs eston rather hesitating if you think she will be of any use ou will get nothing to the purpose from iss ates said mma he will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing he will not even listen to your questions see no advantage in consulting iss ates ut she is so amusing so extremely amusing am very fond of hearing iss ates talk nd need not bring the whole family you know ere r eston joined them and on hearing what was proposed gave it his decided approbation ye do rank o and fetch iss ates and let us end the matter at once he will enjoy the scheme am sure and do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties etch iss ates e are growing a little too nice he is a standing lesson of how to be happy ut fetch them both nvite them both oth sir an the old lady he old lady o the young lady to be sure shall think you a great blockhead rank if you bring the aunt without the niece h beg your pardon sir did not immediately recollect ndoubtedly if you wish it will endeavour to persuade them both nd away he ran ong before he reappeared attending the short neat brisk moving aunt and her elegant niece rs eston like a sweet tempered woman and a good wife had examined the passage again and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before indeed very trifling and here ended the difficulties of decision ll the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth ll the minor arrangements of table and chair lights and music tea and supper made themselves or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between rs eston and rs tokes very body invited was certainly to come rank had already written to nscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight which could not possibly be refused nd a delightful dance it was to be ost cordially when iss ates arrived did she agree that it must s a counsellor she was not wanted but as an approver a much safer character she was truly welcome er approbation at once general and minute warm and incessant could not but please and for another half hour they were all walking to and fro between the different rooms some suggesting some attending and all in happy enjoyment of the future he party did not break up without mma s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening nor without her overhearing r eston whisper to his wife e has asked her my dear hat s right knew he would ne thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to mma its being fixed for a day within the granted term of rank hurchill s stay in urry for in spite of r eston s confidence she could not think it so very impossible that the hurchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight ut this was not judged feasible he preparations must take their time nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on and for a few days they must be planning proceeding and hoping in uncertainty at the risk in her opinion the great risk of its being all in vain nscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word is wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was not opposed ll was safe and prosperous and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another mma being now certain of her ball began to adopt as the next vexation r nightley s provoking indifference about it ither because he did not dance himself or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted he seemed resolved that it should not interest him determined against its exciting any present curiosity or affording him any future amusement o her voluntary communications mma could get no more approving reply than ery well f the estons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment have nothing to say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me h yes must be there could not refuse and will keep as much awake as can but would rather be at home looking over illiam arkins s week s account much rather confess leasure in seeing dancing not indeed never look at it do not know who does ine dancing believe like virtue must be its own reward hose who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different his mma felt was aimed at her and it made her quite angry t was not in compliment to ane airfax however that he was so indifferent or so indignant he was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree t made her animated open hearted she voluntarily said h iss oodhouse hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball hat a disappointment it would be do look forward to it own with very great pleasure t was not to oblige ane airfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of illiam arkins o she was more and more convinced that rs eston was quite mistaken in that surmise here was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side but no love las there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with r nightley wo days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over throw of every thing letter arrived from r hurchill to urge his nephew s instant return rs hurchill was unwell far too unwell to do without him she had been in a very suffering state so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before though from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant habit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it but now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off for nscombe without delay he substance of this letter was forwarded to mma in a note from rs eston instantly s to his going it was inevitable e must be gone within a few hours though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance e knew her illnesses they never occurred but for her own convenience rs eston added that he could only allow himself time to hurry to ighbury after breakfast and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him and that he might be expected at artfield very soon his wretched note was the finale of mma s breakfast hen once it had been read there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim he loss of the ball the loss of the young man and all that the young man might be feeling t was too wretched uch a delightful evening as it would have been very body so happy and she and her partner the happiest said it would be so was the only consolation er father s feelings were quite distinct e thought principally of rs hurchill s illness and wanted to know how she was treated and as for the ball it was shocking to have dear mma disappointed but they would all be safer at home mma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared but if this reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him e felt the going away almost too much to speak of it is dejection was most evident e sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes and when rousing himself it was only to say f all horrid things leave taking is the worst ut you will come again said mma his will not be your only visit to andalls h shaking his head the uncertainty of when may be able to return shall try for it with a zeal t will be the object of all my thoughts and cares and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring but am afraid they did not stir last spring am afraid it is a custom gone for ever ur poor ball must be quite given up h that ball why did we wait for any thing why not seize the pleasure at once ow often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation ou told us it would be so h iss oodhouse why are you always so right ndeed am very sorry to be right in this instance would much rather have been merry than wise f can come again we are still to have our ball y father depends on it o not forget your engagement mma looked graciously uch a fortnight as it has been he continued every day more precious and more delightful than the day before every day making me less fit to bear any other place appy those who can remain at ighbury s you do us such ample justice now said mma laughing will venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first o not we rather surpass your expectations am sure we do am sure you did not much expect to like us ou would not have been so long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of ighbury e laughed rather consciously and though denying the sentiment mma was convinced that it had been so nd you must be off this very morning es my father is to join me here we shall walk back together and must be off immediately am almost afraid that every moment will bring him ot five minutes to spare even for your friends iss airfax and iss ates ow unlucky iss ates s powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours es have called there passing the door thought it better t was a right thing to do went in for three minutes and was detained by iss ates s being absent he was out and felt it impossible not to wait till she came in he is a woman that one may that one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight t was better to pay my visit then e hesitated got up walked to a window n short said he perhaps iss oodhouse think you can hardly be quite without suspicion e looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts he hardly knew what to say t seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious which she did not wish orcing herself to speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said ou are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then e was silent he believed he was looking at her probably reflecting on what she had said and trying to understand the manner he heard him sigh t was natural for him to feel that he had cause to sigh e could not believe her to be encouraging him few awkward moments passed and he sat down again and in a more determined manner said t was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to artfield y regard for artfield is most warm e stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed e was more in love with her than mma had supposed and who can say how it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance r oodhouse soon followed and the necessity of exertion made him composed very few minutes more however completed the present trial r eston always alert when business was to be done and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable as of foreseeing any that was doubtful said t was time to go and the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agree to take leave shall hear about you all said he that is my chief consolation shall hear of every thing that is going on among you have engaged rs eston to correspond with me he has been so kind as to promise it h the blessing of a female correspondent when one is really interested in the absent she will tell me every thing n her letters shall be at dear ighbury again very friendly shake of the hand a very earnest ood bye closed the speech and the door had soon shut out rank hurchill hort had been the notice short their meeting he was gone and mma felt so sorry to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry and feeling it too much t was a sad change hey had been meeting almost every day since his arrival ertainly his being at andalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks indescribable spirit the idea the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners t had been a very happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of artfield days o complete every other recommendation he had almost told her that he loved her hat strength or what constancy of affection he might be subject to was another point but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration a conscious preference of herself and this persuasion joined to all the rest made her think that she must be a little in love with him in spite of every previous determination against it certainly must said she his sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house must be in love should be the oddest creature in the world if were not for a few weeks at least ell evil to some is always good to others shall have many fellow mourners for the ball if not for rank hurchill but r nightley will be happy e may spend the evening with his dear illiam arkins now if he likes r nightley however shewed no triumphant happiness e could not say that he was sorry on his own account his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had but he said and very steadily that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with considerable kindness added ou mma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck t was some days before she saw ane airfax to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change but when they did meet her composure was odious he had been particularly unwell however suffering from headache to a degree which made her aunt declare that had the ball taken place she did not think ane could have attended it and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill health mma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love er ideas only varied as to the how much t first she thought it was a good deal and afterwards but little he had great pleasure in hearing rank hurchill talked of and for his sake greater pleasure than ever in seeing r and rs eston she was very often thinking of him and quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was how were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance of his coming to andalls again this spring ut on the other hand she could not admit herself to be unhappy nor after the first morning to be less disposed for employment than usual she was still busy and cheerful and pleasing as he was she could yet imagine him to have faults and farther though thinking of him so much and as she sat drawing or working forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment fancying interesting dialogues and inventing elegant letters the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she refused him heir affection was always to subside into friendship very thing tender and charming was to mark their parting but still they were to part hen she became sensible of this it struck her that she could not be very much in love for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father never to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice said she n not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is there any allusion to making a sacrifice do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness o much the better certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than do am quite enough in love should be sorry to be more pon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings e is undoubtedly very much in love every thing denotes it very much in love indeed and when he comes again if his affection continue must be on my guard not to encourage it t would be most inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up ot that imagine he can think have been encouraging him hitherto o if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been so wretched ould he have thought himself encouraged his looks and language at parting would have been different till however must be on my guard his is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is but do not know that expect it will do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy is feelings are warm but can imagine them rather changeable very consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved shall do very well again after a little while and then it will be a good thing over for they say every body is in love once in their lives and shall have been let off easily hen his letter to rs eston arrived mma had the perusal of it and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she had undervalued their strength t was a long well written letter giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings expressing all the affection gratitude and respect which was natural and honourable and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive with spirit and precision o suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern it was the language of real feeling towards rs eston and the transition from ighbury to nscombe the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety he charm of her own name was not wanting iss oodhouse appeared more than once and never without a something of pleasing connexion either a compliment to her taste or a remembrance of what she had said and in the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed ompressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words had not a spare moment on uesday as you know for iss oodhouse s beautiful little friend ray make my excuses and adieus to her his mma could not doubt was all for herself arriet was remembered only from being her friend is information and prospects as to nscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated rs hurchill was recovering and he dared not yet even in his own imagination fix a time for coming to andalls again ratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the material part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up and returned to rs eston that it had not added any lasting warmth that she could still do without the writer and that he must learn to do without her er intentions were unchanged er resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness is recollection of arriet and the words which clothed it the beautiful little friend suggested to her the idea of arriet s succeeding her in his affections as it impossible o arriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour or arriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed must not dwell upon it said she must not think of it know the danger of indulging such speculations ut stranger things have happened and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which can already look forward to with pleasure t was well to have a comfort in store on arriet s behalf though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom for evil in that quarter was at hand s rank hurchill s arrival had succeeded r lton s engagement in the conversation of ighbury as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first so now upon rank hurchill s disappearance r lton s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form is wedding day was named e would soon be among them again r lton and his bride here was hardly time to talk over the first letter from nscombe before r lton and his bride was in every body s mouth and rank hurchill was forgotten mma grew sick at the sound he had had three weeks of happy exemption from r lton and arriet s mind she had been willing to hope had been lately gaining strength ith r eston s ball in view at least there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach new carriage bell ringing and all oor arriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that mma could give mma felt that she could not do too much for her that arriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect for ever agreed to without being able to make their opinions the same arriet listened submissively and said it was very true it was just as iss oodhouse described it was not worth while to think about them and she would not think about them any longer but no change of subject could avail and the next half hour saw her as anxious and restless about the ltons as before t last mma attacked her on another ground our allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about r lton s marrying arriet is the strongest reproach you can make me ou could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake fell into t was all my doing know have not forgotten it assure you eceived myself did very miserably deceive you and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever o not imagine me in danger of forgetting it arriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation mma continued have not said exert yourself arriet for my sake think less talk less of r lton for my sake because for your own sake rather would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of self command in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity hese are the motives which have been pressing on you hey are very important and sorry am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them y being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration want you to save yourself from greater pain erhaps may sometimes have felt that arriet would not forget what was due or rather what would be kind by me his appeal to her affections did more than all the rest he idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for iss oodhouse whom she really loved extremely made her wretched for a while and when the violence of grief was comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably ou who have been the best friend ever had in my life ant gratitude to you obody is equal to you care for nobody as do for you h iss oodhouse how ungrateful have been uch expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do made mma feel that she had never loved arriet so well nor valued her affection so highly before here is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she afterwards to herself here is nothing to be compared to it armth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction am sure it will t is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved which gives sabella all her popularity have it not but know how to prize and respect it arriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives ear arriet would not change you for the clearest headed longest sighted best judging female breathing h the coldness of a ane airfax arriet is worth a hundred such nd for a wife a sensible man s wife it is invaluable mention no names but happy the man who changes mma for arriet rs lton was first seen at church but though devotion might be interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid to settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty or not pretty at all mma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects and she made a point of arriet s going with her that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible he could not enter the house again could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago to lace up her boot without recollecting thousand vexatious thoughts would recur ompliments charades and horrible blunders and it was not to be supposed that poor arriet should not be recollecting too but she behaved very well and was only rather pale and silent he visit was of course short and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it that mma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady and on no account to give one beyond the nothing meaning terms of being elegantly dressed and very pleasing he did not really like her he would not be in a hurry to find fault but she suspected that there was no elegance ease but not elegance he was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there was too much ease er person was rather good her face not unpretty but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner were elegant mma thought at least it would turn out so s for r lton his manners did not appear but no she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners t was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it he woman was better off she might have the assistance of fine clothes and the privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own good sense to depend on and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor r lton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married the woman he had wanted to marry and the woman whom he had been expected to marry she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise and to be as much affectedly and as little really easy as could be ell iss oodhouse said arriet when they had quitted the house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ell iss oodhouse with a gentle sigh what do you think of her s not she very charming here was a little hesitation in mma s answer h yes very a very pleasing young woman think her beautiful quite beautiful ery nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love h no there is nothing to surprize one at all pretty fortune and she came in his way dare say returned arriet sighing again dare say she was very much attached to him erhaps she might but it is not every man s fate to marry the woman who loves him best iss awkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have es said arriet earnestly and well she might nobody could ever have a better ell wish them happy with all my heart nd now iss oodhouse do not think shall mind seeing them again e is just as superior as ever but being married you know it is quite a different thing o indeed iss oodhouse you need not be afraid can sit and admire him now without any great misery o know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort he does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves appy creature e called her ugusta ow delightful hen the visit was returned mma made up her mind he could then see more and judge better rom arriet s happening not to be at artfield and her father s being present to engage r lton she had a quarter of an hour of the lady s conversation to herself and could composedly attend to her and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that rs lton was a vain woman extremely well satisfied with herself and thinking much of her own importance that she meant to shine and be very superior but with manners which had been formed in a bad school pert and familiar that all her notions were drawn from one set of people and one style of living that if not foolish she was ignorant and that her society would certainly do r lton no good arriet would have been a better match f not wise or refined herself she would have connected him with those who were but iss awkins it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best of her own set he rich brother in law near ristol was the pride of the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride of him he very first subject after being seated was aple rove y brother r uckling s seat a comparison of artfield to aple rove he grounds of artfield were small but neat and pretty and the house was modern and well built rs lton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room the entrance and all that she could see or imagine ery like aple rove indeed he was quite struck by the likeness hat room was the very shape and size of the morning room at aple rove her sister s favourite room r lton was appealed to as not it astonishingly like he could really almost fancy herself at aple rove nd the staircase ou know as came in observed how very like the staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house really could not help exclaiming assure you iss oodhouse it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place am so extremely partial to as aple rove have spent so many happy months there with a little sigh of sentiment charming place undoubtedly very body who sees it is struck by its beauty but to me it has been quite a home henever you are transplanted like me iss oodhouse you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony mma made as slight a reply as she could but it was fully sufficient for rs lton who only wanted to be talking herself o extremely like aple rove nd it is not merely the house the grounds assure you as far as could observe are strikingly like he laurels at aple rove are in the same profusion as here and stand very much in the same way just across the lawn and had a glimpse of a fine large tree with a bench round it which put me so exactly in mind y brother and sister will be enchanted with this place eople who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style mma doubted the truth of this sentiment he had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else but it was not worth while to attack an error so double dyed and therefore only said in reply hen you have seen more of this country am afraid you will think you have overrated artfield urry is full of beauties h yes am quite aware of that t is the garden of ngland you know urry is the garden of ngland es but we must not rest our claims on that distinction any counties believe are called the garden of ngland as well as urry o fancy not replied rs lton with a most satisfied smile never heard any county but urry called so mma was silenced y brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer at farthest continued rs lton and that will be our time for exploring hile they are with us we shall explore a great deal dare say hey will have their barouche landau of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying any thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well hey would hardly come in their chaise think at that season of the year ndeed when the time draws on shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche landau it will be so very much preferable hen people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know iss oodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible and r uckling is extremely fond of exploring e explored to ing s eston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouche landau ou have many parties of that kind here suppose iss oodhouse every summer o not immediately here e are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of and we are a very quiet set of people believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure h there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort obody can be more devoted to home than am was quite a proverb for it at aple rove any a time has elina said when she has been going to ristol really cannot get this girl to move from the house absolutely must go in by myself though hate being stuck up in the barouche landau without a companion but ugusta believe with her own good will would never stir beyond the park paling any a time has she said so and yet am no advocate for entire seclusion think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little perfectly understand your situation however iss oodhouse looking towards r oodhouse our father s state of health must be a great drawback hy does not he try ath ndeed he should et me recommend ath to you assure you have no doubt of its doing r oodhouse good y father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving any benefit and r erry whose name dare say is not unknown to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now h that s a great pity for assure you iss oodhouse where the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give n my ath life have seen such instances of it nd it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of use to r oodhouse s spirits which understand are sometimes much depressed nd as to its recommendations to you fancy need not take much pains to dwell on them he advantages of ath to the young are pretty generally understood t would be a charming introduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my particular friend rs artridge the lady have always resided with when in ath would be most happy to shew you any attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public with t was as much as mma could bear without being impolite he idea of her being indebted to rs lton for what was called an introduction of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of rs lton s probably some vulgar dashing widow who with the help of a boarder just made a shift to live he dignity of iss oodhouse of artfield was sunk indeed he restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could have given and only thanked rs lton coolly but their going to ath was quite out of the question and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father nd then to prevent farther outrage and indignation changed the subject directly do not ask whether you are musical rs lton pon these occasions a lady s character generally precedes her and ighbury has long known that you are a superior performer h no indeed must protest against any such idea superior performer very far from it assure you onsider from how partial a quarter your information came am doatingly fond of music passionately fond and my friends say am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree ou iss oodhouse well know play delightfully assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society am got into absolutely cannot do without music t is a necessary of life to me and having always been used to a very musical society both at aple rove and in ath it would have been a most serious sacrifice honestly said as much to r when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable and the inferiority of the house too knowing what had been accustomed to of course he was not wholly without apprehension hen he was speaking of it in that way honestly said that the world could give up parties balls plays for had no fear of retirement lessed with so many resources within myself the world was not necessary to me could do very well without it o those who had no resources it was a different thing but my resources made me quite independent nd as to smaller sized rooms than had been used to really could not give it a thought hoped was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description ertainly had been accustomed to every luxury at aple rove but did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments ut said to be quite honest do not think can live without something of a musical society condition for nothing else but without music life would be a blank to me e cannot suppose said mma smiling that r lton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in ighbury and hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive o indeed have no doubts at all on that head am delighted to find myself in such a circle hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together think iss oodhouse you and must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours ill not it be a good plan f we exert ourselves think we shall not be long in want of allies omething of that nature would be particularly desirable for me as an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know there is a sad story against them in general hey are but too apt to give up music ut you who are so extremely fond of it there can be no danger surely should hope not but really when look around among my acquaintance tremble elina has entirely given up music never touches the instrument though she played sweetly nd the same may be said of rs effereys lara artridge that was and of the two ilmans now rs ird and rs ames ooper and of more than can enumerate pon my word it is enough to put one in a fright used to be quite angry with elina but really begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention believe was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper ut every thing of that kind said mma will soon be in so regular a train ell said rs lton laughing we shall see mma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing more to say and after a moment s pause rs lton chose another subject e have been calling at andalls said she and found them both at home and very pleasant people they seem to be like them extremely r eston seems an excellent creature quite a first rate favourite with me already assure you nd she appears so truly good there is something so motherly and kind hearted about her that it wins upon one directly he was your governess think mma was almost too much astonished to answer but rs lton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on aving understood as much was rather astonished to find her so very lady like ut she is really quite the gentlewoman rs eston s manners said mma were always particularly good heir propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest model for any young woman nd who do you think came in while we were there mma was quite at a loss he tone implied some old acquaintance and how could she possibly guess nightley continued rs lton nightley himself as not it lucky for not being within when he called the other day had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of r s had a great curiosity y friend nightley had been so often mentioned that was really impatient to see him and must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend nightley is quite the gentleman like him very much ecidedly think a very gentleman like man appily it was now time to be gone hey were off and mma could breathe nsufferable woman was her immediate exclamation orse than had supposed bsolutely insufferable nightley could not have believed it nightley never seen him in her life before and call him nightley and discover that he is a gentleman little upstart vulgar being with her r and her caro sposo and her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery ctually to discover that r nightley is a gentleman doubt whether he will return the compliment and discover her to be a lady could not have believed it nd to propose that she and should unite to form a musical club ne would fancy we were bosom friends nd rs eston stonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman orse and worse never met with her equal uch beyond my hopes arriet is disgraced by any comparison h what would rank hurchill say to her if he were here ow angry and how diverted he would be h there am thinking of him directly lways the first person to be thought of ow catch myself out rank hurchill comes as regularly into my mind ll this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time her father had arranged himself after the bustle of the ltons departure and was ready to speak she was very tolerably capable of attending ell my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and dare say she was very much pleased with you he speaks a little too quick little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear ut believe am nice do not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor iss aylor owever she seems a very obliging pretty behaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife hough think he had better not have married made the best excuses could for not having been able to wait on him and rs lton on this happy occasion said that hoped should in the course of the summer ut ought to have gone before ot to wait upon a bride is very remiss h it shews what a sad invalid am ut do not like the corner into icarage ane dare say your apologies were accepted sir r lton knows you es but a young lady a bride ought to have paid my respects to her if possible t was being very deficient ut my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride t ought to be no recommendation to you t is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them o my dear never encouraged any body to marry but would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady and a bride especially is never to be neglected ore is avowedly due to her bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they may ell papa if this is not encouragement to marry do not know what is nd should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity baits for poor young ladies y dear you do not understand me his is a matter of mere common politeness and good breeding and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry mma had done er father was growing nervous and could not understand her er mind returned to rs lton s offences and long very long did they occupy her mma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill opinion of rs lton er observation had been pretty correct uch as rs lton appeared to her on this second interview such she appeared whenever they met again self important presuming familiar ignorant and ill bred he had a little beauty and a little accomplishment but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood and conceived iss awkins to have held such a place in society as rs lton s consequence only could surpass here was no reason to suppose r lton thought at all differently from his wife e seemed not merely happy with her but proud e had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to ighbury as not even iss oodhouse could equal and the greater part of her new acquaintance disposed to commend or not in the habit of judging following the lead of iss ates s good will or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself were very well satisfied so that rs lton s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do unimpeded by iss oodhouse who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed n one respect rs lton grew even worse than she had appeared at first er feelings altered towards mma ffended probably by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant and though the effect was agreeable the ill will which produced it was necessarily increasing mma s dislike er manners too and r lton s were unpleasant towards arriet hey were sneering and negligent mma hoped it must rapidly work arriet s cure but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much t was not to be doubted that poor arriet s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve and her own share in the story under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him had in all likelihood been given also he was of course the object of their joint dislike hen they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin abusing iss oodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of arriet rs lton took a great fancy to ane airfax and from the first ot merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other but from the very first and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration but without solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting to assist and befriend her efore mma had forfeited her confidence and about the third time of their meeting she heard all rs lton s knight errantry on the subject ane airfax is absolutely charming iss oodhouse quite rave about ane airfax sweet interesting creature o mild and ladylike and with such talents assure you think she has very extraordinary talents do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point h she is absolutely charming ou will laugh at my warmth but upon my word talk of nothing but ane airfax nd her situation is so calculated to affect one iss oodhouse we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her e must bring her forward uch talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet ull many a flower is born to blush unseen nd waste its fragrance on the desert air e must not allow them to be verified in sweet ane airfax cannot think there is any danger of it was mma s calm answer and when you are better acquainted with iss airfax s situation and understand what her home has been with olonel and rs ampbell have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown h but dear iss oodhouse she is now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown away hatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the ampbells are so palpably at an end nd think she feels it am sure she does he is very timid and silent ne can see that she feels the want of encouragement like her the better for it must confess it is a recommendation to me am a great advocate for timidity and am sure one does not often meet with it ut in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing h assure you ane airfax is a very delightful character and interests me more than can express ou appear to feel a great deal but am not aware how you or any of iss airfax s acquaintance here any of those who have known her longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than y dear iss oodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act ou and need not be afraid f we set the example many will follow it as far as they can though all have not our situations e have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live in a style which could not make the addition of ane airfax at any time the least inconvenient should be extremely displeased if right were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked more than ane airfax to partake of it have no idea of that sort of thing t is not likely that should considering what have been used to y greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense aple rove will probably be my model more than it ought to be for we do not at all affect to equal my brother r uckling in income owever my resolution is taken as to noticing ane airfax shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation y acquaintance is so very extensive that have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets a little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating shall have her very often indeed while they are with me and dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche landau in some of our exploring parties oor ane airfax thought mma ou have not deserved this ou may have done wrong with regard to r ixon but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited he kindness and protection of rs lton ane airfax and ane airfax eavens et me not suppose that she dares go about mma oodhouse ing me ut upon my honour there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman s tongue mma had not to listen to such paradings again to any so exclusively addressed to herself so disgustingly decorated with a dear iss oodhouse he change on rs lton s side soon afterwards appeared and she was left in peace neither forced to be the very particular friend of rs lton nor under rs lton s guidance the very active patroness of ane airfax and only sharing with others in a general way in knowing what was felt what was meditated what was done he looked on with some amusement iss ates s gratitude for rs lton s attentions to ane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth he was quite one of her worthies the most amiable affable delightful woman just as accomplished and condescending as rs lton meant to be considered mma s only surprize was that ane airfax should accept those attentions and tolerate rs lton as she seemed to do he heard of her walking with the ltons sitting with the ltons spending a day with the ltons his was astonishing he could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of iss airfax could endure such society and friendship as the icarage had to offer he is a riddle quite a riddle said she o chuse to remain here month after month under privations of every sort nd now to chuse the mortification of rs lton s notice and the penury of her conversation rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real generous affection ane had come to ighbury professedly for three months the ampbells were gone to reland for three months but now the ampbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till idsummer and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there ccording to iss ates it all came from her rs ixon had written most pressingly ould ane but go means were to be found servants sent friends contrived no travelling difficulty allowed to exist but still she had declined it he must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing this invitation was mma s conclusion he must be under some sort of penance inflicted either by the ampbells or herself here is great fear great caution great resolution somewhere he is not to be with the ixons he decree is issued by somebody ut why must she consent to be with the ltons ere is quite a separate puzzle pon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject before the few who knew her opinion of rs lton rs eston ventured this apology for ane e cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the icarage my dear mma but it is better than being always at home er aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome e must consider what iss airfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to ou are right rs eston said r nightley warmly iss airfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of rs lton ould she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her ut with a reproachful smile at mma she receives attentions from rs lton which nobody else pays her mma felt that rs eston was giving her a momentary glance and she was herself struck by his warmth ith a faint blush she presently replied uch attentions as rs lton s should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify iss airfax rs lton s invitations should have imagined any thing but inviting should not wonder said rs eston if iss airfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting rs lton s civilities for her oor iss ates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change oth felt rather anxious to hear him speak again and after a few minutes silence he said nother thing must be taken into consideration too rs lton does not talk to iss airfax as she speaks of her e all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted e cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before e feel things differently nd besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that iss airfax awes rs lton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face rs lton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to uch a woman as ane airfax probably never fell in rs lton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness know how highly you think of ane airfax said mma ittle enry was in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say es he replied any body may know how highly think of her nd yet said mma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon stopping it was better however to know the worst at once she hurried on nd yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is he extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other r nightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together or some other cause brought the colour into his face as he answered h are you there ut you are miserably behindhand r ole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago e stopped mma felt her foot pressed by rs eston and did not herself know what to think n a moment he went on hat will never be however can assure you iss airfax dare say would not have me if were to ask her and am very sure shall never ask her mma returned her friend s pressure with interest and was pleased enough to exclaim ou are not vain r nightley will say that for you e seemed hardly to hear her he was thoughtful and in a manner which shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said o you have been settling that should marry ane airfax o indeed have not ou have scolded me too much for match making for me to presume to take such a liberty with you hat said just now meant nothing ne says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning h no upon my word have not the smallest wish for your marrying ane airfax or ane any body ou would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married r nightley was thoughtful again he result of his reverie was o mma do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize never had a thought of her in that way assure you nd soon afterwards ane airfax is a very charming young woman but not even ane airfax is perfect he has a fault he has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife mma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault ell said she and you soon silenced r ole suppose es very soon e gave me a quiet hint told him he was mistaken he asked my pardon and said no more ole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours n that respect how unlike dear rs lton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world wonder how she speaks of the oles what she calls them ow can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity he calls you nightley what can she do for r ole nd so am not to be surprized that ane airfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her rs eston your argument weighs most with me can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from iss ates than can believe in the triumph of iss airfax s mind over rs lton have no faith in rs lton s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau ane airfax has feeling said r nightley do not accuse her of want of feeling er sensibilities suspect are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self controul but it wants openness he is reserved more reserved think than she used to be nd love an open temper o till ole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head saw ane airfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond ell rs eston said mma triumphantly when he left them what do you say now to r nightley s marrying ane airfax hy really dear mma say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last o not beat me very body in and about ighbury who had ever visited r lton was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage inner parties and evening parties were made for him and his lady and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day see how it is said she see what a life am to lead among you pon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated e really seem quite the fashion f this is living in the country it is nothing very formidable rom onday next to aturday assure you we have not a disengaged day woman with fewer resources than have need not have been at a loss o invitation came amiss to her er ath habits made evening parties perfectly natural to her and aple rove had given her a taste for dinners he was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms at the poor attempt at rout cakes and there being no ice in the ighbury card parties rs ates rs erry rs oddard and others were a good deal behind hand in knowledge of the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged n the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party in which her card tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order mma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner at artfield for the ltons hey must not do less than others or she should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable of pitiful resentment dinner there must be fter mma had talked about it for ten minutes r oodhouse felt no unwillingness and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him he persons to be invited required little thought esides the ltons it must be the estons and r nightley so far it was all of course and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little arriet must be asked to make the eighth but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction and on many accounts mma was particularly pleased by arriet s begging to be allowed to decline it he would rather not be in his company more than she could help he was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together without feeling uncomfortable f iss oodhouse would not be displeased she would rather stay at home t was precisely what mma would have wished had she deemed it possible enough for wishing he was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth ane airfax ince her last conversation with rs eston and r nightley she was more conscience stricken about ane airfax than she had often been r nightley s words dwelt with her e had said that ane airfax received attentions from rs lton which nobody else paid her his is very true said she at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meant and it is very shameful f the same age and always knowing her ought to have been more her friend he will never like me now have neglected her too long ut will shew her greater attention than have done very invitation was successful hey were all disengaged and all happy he preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet over circumstance rather unlucky occurred he two eldest little nightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them and staying one whole day at artfield which one day would be the very day of this party is professional engagements did not allow of his being put off but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so r oodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear and here would be a ninth and mma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to artfield for forty eight hours without falling in with a dinner party he comforted her father better than she could comfort herself by representing that though he certainly would make them nine yet he always said so little that the increase of noise would be very immaterial he thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother he event was more favourable to r oodhouse than to mma ohn nightley came but r eston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day e might be able to join them in the evening but certainly not to dinner r oodhouse was quite at ease and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate removed the chief of even mma s vexation he day came the party were punctually assembled and r ohn nightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable nstead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner he was talking to iss airfax rs lton as elegant as lace and pearls could make her he looked at in silence wanting only to observe enough for sabella s information but iss airfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could talk to her e had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys when it had been just beginning to rain t was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject and he said hope you did not venture far iss airfax this morning or am sure you must have been wet e scarcely got home in time hope you turned directly went only to the post office said she and reached home before the rain was much t is my daily errand always fetch the letters when am here t saves trouble and is a something to get me out walk before breakfast does me good ot a walk in the rain should imagine o but it did not absolutely rain when set out r ohn nightley smiled and replied hat is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards from your own door when had the pleasure of meeting you and enry and ohn had seen more drops than they could count long before he post office has a great charm at one period of our lives hen you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for here was a little blush and then this answer must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every dearest connexion and therefore cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters ndifferent h no never conceived you could become indifferent etters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very positive curse ou are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly usiness you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does h you are not serious now know r ohn nightley too well am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference it is not age but situation ou have every body dearest to you always at hand probably never shall again and therefore till have outlived all my affections a post office think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than to day hen talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years said ohn nightley meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings consider one as including the other ime will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle but that is not the change had in view for you s an old friend you will allow me to hope iss airfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as have t was kindly said and very far from giving offence pleasant thank you seemed meant to laugh it off but a blush a quivering lip a tear in the eye shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh er attention was now claimed by r oodhouse who being according to his custom on such occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies was ending with her and with all his mildest urbanity said am very sorry to hear iss airfax of your being out this morning in the rain oung ladies should take care of themselves oung ladies are delicate plants hey should take care of their health and their complexion y dear did you change your stockings es sir did indeed and am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me y dear iss airfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for hope your good grand mama and aunt are well hey are some of my very old friends wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour ou do us a great deal of honour to day am sure y daughter and are both highly sensible of your goodness and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at artfield he kind hearted polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy y this time the walk in the rain had reached rs lton and her remonstrances now opened upon ane y dear ane what is this hear oing to the post office in the rain his must not be assure you ou sad girl how could you do such a thing t is a sign was not there to take care of you ane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold h do not tell me ou really are a very sad girl and do not know how to take care of yourself o the post office indeed rs eston did you ever hear the like ou and must positively exert our authority y advice said rs eston kindly and persuasively certainly do feel tempted to give iss airfax you must not run such risks iable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year he spring always think requires more than common care etter wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again ow do not you feel that you had es am sure you are much too reasonable ou look as if you would not do such a thing again h she shall not do such a thing again eagerly rejoined rs lton e will not allow her to do such a thing again and nodding significantly there must be some arrangement made there must indeed shall speak to r he man who fetches our letters every morning one of our men forget his name shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you hat will obviate all difficulties you know and from us really think my dear ane you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation ou are extremely kind said ane but cannot give up my early walk am advised to be out of doors as much as can must walk somewhere and the post office is an object and upon my word have scarcely ever had a bad morning before y dear ane say no more about it he thing is determined that is laughing affectedly as far as can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master ou know rs eston you and must be cautious how we express ourselves ut do flatter myself my dear ane that my influence is not entirely worn out f meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as settled xcuse me said ane earnestly cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant f the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it always is when am not here by my grandmama s h my dear but so much as atty has to do nd it is a kindness to employ our men ane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered but instead of answering she began speaking again to r ohn nightley he post office is a wonderful establishment said she he regularity and despatch of it f one thinks of all that it has to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing t is certainly very well regulated o seldom that any negligence or blunder appears o seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million suppose actually lost nd when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder he clerks grow expert from habit hey must begin with some quickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them f you want any farther explanation continued he smiling they are paid for it hat is the key to a great deal of capacity he public pays and must be served well he varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual observations made have heard it asserted said ohn nightley that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough ut for that reason should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get sabella and mma think do write very much alike have not always known their writing apart es said his brother hesitatingly there is a likeness know what you mean but mma s hand is the strongest sabella and mma both write beautifully said r oodhouse and always did nd so does poor rs eston with half a sigh and half a smile at her never saw any gentleman s handwriting mma began looking also at rs eston but stopped on perceiving that rs eston was attending to some one else and the pause gave her time to reflect ow how am going to introduce him m unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people s it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase our orkshire friend your correspondent in orkshire that would be the way suppose if were very bad o can pronounce his name without the smallest distress certainly get better and better ow for it rs eston was disengaged and mma began again r rank hurchill writes one of the best gentleman s hands ever saw do not admire it said r nightley t is too small wants strength t is like a woman s writing his was not submitted to by either lady hey vindicated him against the base aspersion o it by no means wanted strength it was not a large hand but very clear and certainly strong ad not rs eston any letter about her to produce o she had heard from him very lately but having answered the letter had put it away f we were in the other room said mma if had my writing desk am sure could produce a specimen have a note of his o not you remember rs eston employing him to write for you one day e chose to say he was employed ell well have that note and can shew it after dinner to convince r nightley h when a gallant young man like r rank hurchill said r nightley dryly writes to a fair lady like iss oodhouse he will of course put forth his best inner was on table rs lton before she could be spoken to was ready and before r oodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining parlour was saying ust go first really am ashamed of always leading the way ane s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped mma he had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any he suspected that it had that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear and that it had not been in vain he thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual a glow both of complexion and spirits he could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the expense of the rish mails it was at her tongue s end but she abstained he was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt ane airfax s feelings and they followed the other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance of good will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each hen the ladies returned to the drawing room after dinner mma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did rs lton engross ane airfax and slight herself he and rs eston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together rs lton left them no choice f ane repressed her for a little time she soon began again and though much that passed between them was in a half whisper especially on rs lton s side there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects he post office catching cold fetching letters and friendship were long under discussion and to them succeeded one which must be at least equally unpleasant to ane inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her and professions of rs lton s meditated activity ere is pril come said she get quite anxious about you une will soon be here ut have never fixed on une or any other month merely looked forward to the summer in general ut have you really heard of nothing have not even made any inquiry do not wish to make any yet h my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing not aware said ane shaking her head dear rs lton who can have thought of it as have done ut you have not seen so much of the world as have ou do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round aple rove cousin of r uckling rs ragge had such an infinity of applications every body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle ax candles in the schoolroom ou may imagine how desirable f all houses in the kingdom rs ragge s is the one would most wish to see you in olonel and rs ampbell are to be in town again by midsummer said ane must spend some time with them am sure they will want it afterwards may probably be glad to dispose of myself ut would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present rouble aye know your scruples ou are afraid of giving me trouble but assure you my dear ane the ampbells can hardly be more interested about you than am shall write to rs artridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look out for any thing eligible hank you but would rather you did not mention the subject to her till the time draws nearer do not wish to be giving any body trouble ut my dear child the time is drawing near here is pril and une or say even uly is very near with such business to accomplish before us our inexperience really amuses me situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moment s notice indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly xcuse me ma am but this is by no means my intention make no inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends hen am quite determined as to the time am not at all afraid of being long unemployed here are places in town offices where inquiry would soon produce something ffices for the sale not quite of human flesh but of human intellect h my dear human flesh ou quite shock me if you mean a fling at the slave trade assure you r uckling was always rather a friend to the abolition did not mean was not thinking of the slave trade replied ane governess trade assure you was all that had in view widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on but as to the greater misery of the victims do not know where it lies ut only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do omething that would do repeated rs lton ye that may suit your humble ideas of yourself know what a modest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of life ou are very obliging but as to all that am very indifferent it would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications think would only be the greater should suffer more from comparison gentleman s family is all that should condition for know you know you you would take up with any thing but shall be a little more nice and am sure the good ampbells will be quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right to move in the first circle our musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like and mix in the family as much as you chose that is do not know if you knew the harp you might do all that am very sure but you sing as well as play yes really believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what you chose and you must and shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before the ampbells or have any rest ou may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of such a situation together said ane they are pretty sure to be equal however am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me am exceedingly obliged to you rs lton am obliged to any body who feels for me but am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer or two or three months longer shall remain where am and as am nd am quite serious too assure you replied rs lton gaily in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends to watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us n this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing till r oodhouse came into the room her vanity had then a change of object and mma heard her saying in the same half whisper to ane ere comes this dear old beau of mine protest nly think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men what a dear creature he is assure you like him excessively admire all that quaint old fashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease modern ease often disgusts me ut this good old r oodhouse wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner h assure you began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous fancy am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown ow do you like it elina s choice handsome think but do not know whether it is not over trimmed have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over trimmed quite a horror of finery must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste is all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery ut am quite in the minority believe few people seem to value simplicity of dress show and finery are every thing have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin o you think it will look well he whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing room when r eston made his appearance among them e had returned to a late dinner and walked to artfield as soon as it was over e had been too much expected by the best judges for surprize but there was great joy r oodhouse was almost as glad to see him now as he would have been sorry to see him before ohn nightley only was in mute astonishment hat a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in ondon should set off again and walk half a mile to another man s house for the sake of being in mixed company till bed time of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers was a circumstance to strike him deeply man who had been in motion since eight o clock in the morning and might now have been still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had been in more than one crowd and might have been alone uch a man to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the evening of a cold sleety pril day rush out again into the world ould he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party ohn nightley looked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and said could not have believed it even of him r eston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all the right of being principal talker which a day spent anywhere from home confers was making himself agreeable among the rest and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard was proceeding to a family communication which though principally addressed to rs eston he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room e gave her a letter it was from rank and to herself he had met with it in his way and had taken the liberty of opening it ead it read it said he it will give you pleasure only a few lines will not take you long read it to mma he two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued but very audible to every body ell he is coming you see good news think ell what do you say to it always told you he would be here again soon did not nne my dear did not always tell you so and you would not believe me n town next week you see at the latest dare say for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done most likely they will be there to morrow or aturday s to her illness all nothing of course ut it is an excellent thing to have rank among us again so near as town hey will stay a good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us his is precisely what wanted ell pretty good news is not it ave you finished it as mma read it all ut it up put it up we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not do now shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way rs eston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion er looks and words had nothing to restrain them he was happy she knew she was happy and knew she ought to be happy er congratulations were warm and open but mma could not speak so fluently he was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings and trying to understand the degree of her agitation which she rather thought was considerable r eston however too eager to be very observant too communicative to want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already t was well that he took every body s joy for granted or he might not have thought either r oodhouse or r nightley particularly delighted hey were the first entitled after rs eston and mma to be made happy from them he would have proceeded to iss airfax but she was so deep in conversation with ohn nightley that it would have been too positive an interruption and finding himself close to rs lton and her attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her hope shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you said r eston rs lton very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope smiled most graciously ou have heard of a certain rank hurchill presume he continued and know him to be my son though he does not bear my name h yes and shall be very happy in his acquaintance am sure r lton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the icarage ou are very obliging rank will be extremely happy am sure e is to be in town next week if not sooner e have notice of it in a letter to day met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my son s hand presumed to open it though it was not directed to me it was to rs eston he is his principal correspondent assure you hardly ever get a letter nd so you absolutely opened what was directed to her h r eston laughing affectedly must protest against that most dangerous precedent indeed beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example pon my word if this is what am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselves h r eston could not have believed it of you ye we men are sad fellows ou must take care of yourself rs lton his letter tells us it is a short letter written in a hurry merely to give us notice it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly on rs hurchill s account she has not been well the whole winter and thinks nscombe too cold for her so they are all to move southward without loss of time ndeed from orkshire think nscombe is in orkshire es they are about one hundred and ninety miles from ondon a considerable journey es upon my word very considerable ixty five miles farther than from aple rove to ondon ut what is distance r eston to people of large fortune ou would be amazed to hear how my brother r uckling sometimes flies about ou will hardly believe me but twice in one week he and r ragge went to ondon and back again with four horses he evil of the distance from nscombe said r eston is that rs hurchill as we understand has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together n rank s last letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle s his you know speaks a great degree of weakness but now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to sleep only two nights on the road o rank writes word ertainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions rs lton ou must grant me that o indeed shall grant you nothing lways take the part of my own sex do indeed give you notice ou will find me a formidable antagonist on that point always stand up for women and assure you if you knew how elina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at rs hurchill s making incredible exertions to avoid it elina says it is quite horror to her and believe have caught a little of her nicety he always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution oes rs hurchill do the same epend upon it rs hurchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did rs hurchill will not be second to any lady in the land for rs lton eagerly interposed with h r eston do not mistake me elina is no fine lady assure you o not run away with such an idea s not she hen she is no rule for rs hurchill who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld rs lton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly t was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was not a fine lady perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it and she was considering in what way she had best retract when r eston went on rs hurchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect but this is quite between ourselves he is very fond of rank and therefore would not speak ill of her esides she is out of health now but that indeed by her own account she has always been would not say so to every body rs lton but have not much faith in rs hurchill s illness f she is really ill why not go to ath r eston o ath or to lifton he has taken it into her head that nscombe is too cold for her he fact is suppose that she is tired of nscombe he has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever was before and she begins to want change t is a retired place fine place but very retired ye like aple rove dare say othing can stand more retired from the road than aple rove uch an immense plantation all round it ou seem shut out from every thing in the most complete retirement nd rs hurchill probably has not health or spirits like elina to enjoy that sort of seclusion r perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life always say a woman cannot have too many resources and feel very thankful that have so many myself as to be quite independent of society rank was here in ebruary for a fortnight o remember to have heard e will find an addition to the society of ighbury when he comes again that is if may presume to call myself an addition ut perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world his was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by and r eston with a very good grace immediately exclaimed y dear madam obody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible ot heard of you believe rs eston s letters lately have been full of very little else than rs lton e had done his duty and could return to his son hen rank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this day s news doubly welcome t has been completely unexpected hat is always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon was sure something favourable would turn up but nobody believed me e and rs eston were both dreadfully desponding ow could he contrive to come nd how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again and so forth always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see have observed rs lton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next ery true r eston perfectly true t is just what used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be ay before ymen s saffron robe would be put on for us h the pains have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views he carriage we had disappointments about the carriage one morning remember he came to me quite in despair he was stopped by a slight fit of coughing and r eston instantly seized the opportunity of going on ou were mentioning ay ay is the very month which rs hurchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than nscombe in short to spend in ondon so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from rank the whole spring precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise hen he was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in ebruary you know and we could not do half that we intended ow will be the time his will be complete enjoyment and do not know rs lton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house think it is so think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy e is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy rs eston s partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me he thinks nobody equal to him nd assure you r eston have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour have heard so much in praise of r rank hurchill t the same time it is fair to observe that am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others give you notice that as find your son so shall judge of him am no flatterer r eston was musing hope said he presently have not been severe upon poor rs hurchill f she is ill should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance could wish ou cannot be ignorant rs lton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment have met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her he was the instigator rank s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her r hurchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wife s his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence nd what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood he was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever since her being turned into a hurchill she has out hurchill d them all in high and mighty claims but in herself assure you she is an upstart nly think well that must be infinitely provoking have quite a horror of upstarts aple rove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves our description of rs hurchill made me think of them directly eople of the name of upman very lately settled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at est all and how they got their fortune nobody knows hey came from irmingham which is not a place to promise much you know r eston ne has not great hopes from irmingham always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing more is positively known of the upmans though a good many things assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother r uckling who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours t is infinitely too bad r uckling who has been eleven years a resident at aple rove and whose father had it before him believe at least am almost sure that old r uckling had completed the purchase before his death hey were interrupted ea was carrying round and r eston having said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of walking away fter tea r and rs eston and r lton sat down with r oodhouse to cards he remaining five were left to their own powers and mma doubted their getting on very well for r nightley seemed little disposed for conversation rs lton was wanting notice which nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent r ohn nightley proved more talkative than his brother e was to leave them early the next day and he soon began with ell mma do not believe have any thing more to say about the boys but you have your sister s letter and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure y charge would be much more concise than her s and probably not much in the same spirit all that have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic them rather hope to satisfy you both said mma for shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for sabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic nd if you find them troublesome you must send them home again hat is very likely ou think so do not you hope am aware that they may be too noisy for your father or even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately ncrease ertainly you must be sensible that the last half year has made a great difference in your way of life ifference o indeed am not here can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be itness this very time ere am come down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinner party hen did it happen before or any thing like it our neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it little while ago every letter to sabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at r ole s or balls at the rown he difference which andalls andalls alone makes in your goings on is very great es said his brother quickly it is andalls that does it all ery well and as andalls suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing mma that enry and ohn may be sometimes in the way nd if they are only beg you to send them home o cried r nightley that need not be the consequence et them be sent to onwell shall certainly be at leisure pon my word exclaimed mma you amuse me should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys hese amazing engagements of mine what have they been ining once with the oles and having a ball talked of which never took place can understand you nodding at r ohn nightley your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed ut you turning to r nightley who know how very very seldom am ever two hours from artfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me cannot imagine nd as to my dear little boys must say that if unt mma has not time for them do not think they would fare much better with ncle nightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts r nightley seemed to be trying not to smile and succeeded without difficulty upon rs lton s beginning to talk to him very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy mma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of rank hurchill he was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed it was for him er own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing it was not worth thinking of but if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away it would be very distressing f a separation of two months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils before her caution for him and for herself would be necessary he did not mean to have her own affections entangled again and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his he wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration hat would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance and yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive he felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis an event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state t was not very long though rather longer than r eston had foreseen before she had the power of forming some opinion of rank hurchill s feelings he nscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined but he was at ighbury very soon afterwards e rode down for a couple of hours he could not yet do more but as he came from andalls immediately to artfield she could then exercise all her quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced and how she must act hey met with the utmost friendliness here could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her ut she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree he watched him well t was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been bsence with the conviction probably of her indifference had produced this very natural and very desirable effect e was in high spirits as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories and he was not without agitation t was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference e was not calm his spirits were evidently fluttered there was restlessness about him ively as he was it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself but what decided her belief on the subject was his staying only a quarter of an hour and hurrying away to make other calls in ighbury e had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed he had not stopped he would not stop for more than a word but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call and much as he wished to stay longer at artfield he must hurry off he had no doubt as to his being less in love but neither his agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed like a perfect cure and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long his was the only visit from rank hurchill in the course of ten days e was often hoping intending to come but was always prevented is aunt could not bear to have him leave her uch was his own account at andall s f he were quite sincere if he really tried to come it was to be inferred that rs hurchill s removal to ondon had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder hat she was really ill was very certain he had declared himself convinced of it at andalls hough much might be fancy he could not doubt when he looked back that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago e did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her but he could not be prevailed on by all his father s doubts to say that her complaints were merely imaginary or that she was as strong as ever t soon appeared that ondon was not the place for her he could not endure its noise er nerves were under continual irritation and suffering and by the ten days end her nephew s letter to andalls communicated a change of plan hey were going to remove immediately to ichmond rs hurchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwise a fancy for the place ready furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change mma heard that rank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends for the house was taken for ay and une he was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them almost as often as he could even wish mma saw how r eston understood these joyous prospects e was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered he hoped it was not so wo months must bring it to the proof r eston s own happiness was indisputable e was quite delighted t was the very circumstance he could have wished for ow it would be really having rank in their neighbourhood hat were nine miles to a young man n hour s ride e would be always coming over he difference in that respect of ichmond and ondon was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never ixteen miles nay eighteen it must be full eighteen to anchester street was a serious obstacle ere he ever able to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning here was no comfort in having him in ondon he might as well be at nscombe but ichmond was the very distance for easy intercourse etter than nearer ne good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal the ball at the rown t had not been forgotten before but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day ow however it was absolutely to be every preparation was resumed and very soon after the hurchills had removed to ichmond a few lines from rank to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty four hours at any given time induced them to name as early a day as possible r eston s ball was to be a real thing very few to morrows stood between the young people of ighbury and happiness r oodhouse was resigned he time of year lightened the evil to him ay was better for every thing than ebruary rs ates was engaged to spend the evening at artfield ames had due notice and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little enry nor dear little ohn would have any thing the matter with them while dear mma were gone o misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball he day approached the day arrived and after a morning of some anxious watching rank hurchill in all the certainty of his own self reached andalls before dinner and every thing was safe o second meeting had there yet been between him and mma he room at the rown was to witness it but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd r eston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man s company he was to convey arriet and they drove to the rown in good time the andalls party just sufficiently before them rank hurchill seemed to have been on the watch and though he did not say much his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening hey all walked about together to see that every thing was as it should be and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage which mma could not hear the sound of at first without great surprize o unreasonably early she was going to exclaim but she presently found that it was a family of old friends who were coming like herself by particular desire to help r eston s judgment and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection mma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which r eston depended and felt that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity he liked his open manners but a little less of open heartedness would have made him a higher character eneral benevolence but not general friendship made a man what he ought to be he could fancy such a man he whole party walked about and looked and praised again and then having nothing else to do formed a sort of half circle round the fire to observe in their various modes till other subjects were started that though ay a fire in the evening was still very pleasant mma found that it was not r eston s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger hey had stopped at rs ates s door to offer the use of their carriage but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the ltons rank was standing by her but not steadily there was a restlessness which shewed a mind not at ease e was looking about he was going to the door he was watching for the sound of other carriages impatient to begin or afraid of being always near her rs lton was spoken of think she must be here soon said he have a great curiosity to see rs lton have heard so much of her t cannot be long think before she comes carriage was heard e was on the move immediately but coming back said am forgetting that am not acquainted with her have never seen either r or rs lton have no business to put myself forward r and rs lton appeared and all the smiles and the proprieties passed ut iss ates and iss airfax said r eston looking about e thought you were to bring them he mistake had been slight he carriage was sent for them now mma longed to know what rank s first opinion of rs lton might be how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress and her smiles of graciousness e was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion by giving her very proper attention after the introduction had passed n a few minutes the carriage returned omebody talked of rain will see that there are umbrellas sir said rank to his father iss ates must not be forgotten and away he went r eston was following but rs lton detained him to gratify him by her opinion of his son and so briskly did she begin that the young man himself though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out of hearing very fine young man indeed r eston ou know candidly told you should form my own opinion and am happy to say that am extremely pleased with him ou may believe me never compliment think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what like and approve so truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism ou must know have a vast dislike to puppies quite a horror of them hey were never tolerated at aple rove either r uckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we used sometimes to say very cutting things elina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them much better hile she talked of his son r eston s attention was chained but when she got to aple rove he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must hurry away rs lton turned to rs eston have no doubt of its being our carriage with iss ates and ane ur coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious believe we drive faster than any body hat a pleasure it is to send one s carriage for a friend understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary ou may be very sure shall always take care of them iss ates and iss airfax escorted by the two gentlemen walked into the room and rs lton seemed to think it as much her duty as rs eston s to receive them er gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like mma but her words every body s words were soon lost under the incessant flow of iss ates who came in talking and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire s the door opened she was heard o very obliging of you o rain at all othing to signify do not care for myself uite thick shoes

standing about among such friends nd such a noble fire am quite roasted o coffee thank you for me never take coffee little tea if you please sir by and bye no hurry h here it comes very thing so good rank hurchill returned to his station by mma and as soon as iss ates was quiet she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of rs lton and iss airfax who were standing a little way behind her e was thoughtful hether he were overhearing too she could not determine fter a good many compliments to ane on her dress and look compliments very quietly and properly taken rs lton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself and it was ow do you like my gown ow do you like my trimming ow has right done my hair with many other relative questions all answered with patient politeness rs lton then said obody can think less of dress in general than do but upon such an occasion as this when every body s eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the estons who have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour would not wish to be inferior to others nd see very few pearls in the room except mine o rank hurchill is a capital dancer understand e shall see if our styles suit fine young man certainly is rank hurchill like him very well t this moment rank began talking so vigorously that mma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want to hear more and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while till another suspension brought rs lton s tones again distinctly forward r lton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming h you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion was this moment telling ane thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us ane repeated rank hurchill with a look of surprize and displeasure hat is easy but iss airfax does not disapprove it suppose ow do you like rs lton said mma in a whisper ot at all ou are ungrateful ngrateful hat do you mean hen changing from a frown to a smile o do not tell me do not want to know what you mean here is my father hen are we to begin dancing mma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour e walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both r and rs eston e had met with them in a little perplexity which must be laid before mma t had just occurred to rs eston that rs lton must be asked to begin the ball that she would expect it which interfered with all their wishes of giving mma that distinction mma heard the sad truth with fortitude nd what are we to do for a proper partner for her said r eston he will think rank ought to ask her rank turned instantly to mma to claim her former promise and boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most perfect approbation of and it then appeared that rs eston was wanting him to dance with rs lton himself and that their business was to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon r eston and rs lton led the way r rank hurchill and iss oodhouse followed mma must submit to stand second to rs lton though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her t was almost enough to make her think of marrying rs lton had undoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified for though she had intended to begin with rank hurchill she could not lose by the change r eston might be his son s superior n spite of this little rub however mma was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her he was more disturbed by r nightley s not dancing than by any thing else here he was among the standers by where he ought not to be he ought to be dancing not classing himself with the husbands and fathers and whist players who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up so young as he looked e could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere than where he had placed himself is tall firm upright figure among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men was such as mma felt must draw every body s eyes and excepting her own partner there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him e moved a few steps nearer and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner with what natural grace he must have danced would he but take the trouble henever she caught his eye she forced him to smile but in general he was looking grave he wished he could love a ballroom better and could like rank hurchill better e seemed often observing her he must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel afraid here was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner hey seemed more like cheerful easy friends than lovers hat rank hurchill thought less of her than he had done was indubitable he ball proceeded pleasantly he anxious cares the incessant attentions of rs eston were not thrown away very body seemed happy and the praise of being a delightful ball which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this f very important very recordable events it was not more productive than such meetings usually are here was one however which mma thought something of he two last dances before supper were begun and arriet had no partner the only young lady sitting down and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder ut mma s wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing r lton sauntering about e would not ask arriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided she was sure he would not and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card room scape however was not his plan e came to the part of the room where the sitters by were collected spoke to some and walked about in front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining it e did not omit being sometimes directly before iss mith or speaking to those who were close to her mma saw it he was not yet dancing she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around and by only turning her head a little she saw it all hen she was half way up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch but r lton was so near that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and rs eston and she perceived that his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only listening also but even encouraging him by significant glances he kind hearted gentle rs eston had left her seat to join him and say o not you dance r lton to which his prompt reply was ost readily rs eston if you will dance with me e oh no would get you a better partner than myself am no dancer f rs ilbert wishes to dance said he shall have great pleasure am sure for though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like rs ilbert rs ilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady disengaged whom should be very glad to see dancing iss mith iss mith oh had not observed ou are extremely obliging and if were not an old married man ut my dancing days are over rs eston ou will excuse me ny thing else should be most happy to do at your command but my dancing days are over rs eston said no more and mma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat his was r lton the amiable obliging gentle r lton he looked round for a moment he had joined r nightley at a little distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife he would not look again er heart was in a glow and she feared her face might be as hot n another moment a happier sight caught her r nightley leading arriet to the set ever had she been more surprized seldom more delighted than at that instant he was all pleasure and gratitude both for arriet and herself and longed to be thanking him and though too distant for speech her countenance said much as soon as she could catch his eye again is dancing proved to be just what she had believed it extremely good and arriet would have seemed almost too lucky if it had not been for the cruel state of things before and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced t was not thrown away on her she bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle and was in a continual course of smiles r lton had retreated into the card room looking mma trusted very foolish he did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife though growing very like her she spoke some of her feelings by observing audibly to her partner nightley has taken pity on poor little iss mith ery goodnatured declare upper was announced he move began and iss ates might be heard from that moment without interruption till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon ane ane my dear ane where are you ere is your tippet rs eston begs you to put on your tippet he says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been done ne door nailed up uantities of matting y dear ane indeed you must r hurchill oh you are too obliging ow well you put it on so gratified xcellent dancing indeed es my dear ran home as said should to help grandmama to bed and got back again and nobody missed me set off without saying a word just as told you randmama was quite well had a charming evening with r oodhouse a vast deal of chat and backgammon ea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her throws and she inquired a great deal about you how you were amused and who were your partners h said shall not forestall ane left her dancing with r eorge tway she will love to tell you all about it herself to morrow her first partner was r lton do not know who will ask her next perhaps r illiam ox y dear sir you are too obliging s there nobody you would not rather am not helpless ir you are most kind pon my word ane on one arm and me on the other top stop let us stand a little back rs lton is going dear rs lton how elegant she looks eautiful lace ow we all follow in her train uite the queen of the evening ell here we are at the passage wo steps ane take care of the two steps h no there is but one ell was persuaded there were two ow very odd was convinced there were two and there is but one never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style andles everywhere was telling you of your grandmama ane here was a little disappointment he baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first and good r oodhouse not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again ow there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus so she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body for fear of its getting round to dear iss oodhouse who would be so very much concerned ell this is brilliant am all amazement could not have supposed any thing uch elegance and profusion have seen nothing like it since ell where shall we sit where shall we sit nywhere so that ane is not in a draught here sit is of no consequence h do you recommend this side ell am sure r hurchill only it seems too good but just as you please hat you direct in this house cannot be wrong ear ane how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama oup too less me should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and cannot help beginning mma had no opportunity of speaking to r nightley till after supper but when they were all in the ballroom again her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked e was warm in his reprobation of r lton s conduct it had been unpardonable rudeness and rs lton s looks also received the due share of censure hey aimed at wounding more than arriet said he mma why is it that they are your enemies e looked with smiling penetration and on receiving no answer added he ought not to be angry with you suspect whatever he may be o that surmise you say nothing of course but confess mma that you did want him to marry arriet did replied mma and they cannot forgive me e shook his head but there was a smile of indulgence with it and he only said shall not scold you leave you to your own reflections an you trust me with such flatterers oes my vain spirit ever tell me am wrong ot your vain spirit but your serious spirit f one leads you wrong am sure the other tells you of it do own myself to have been completely mistaken in r lton here is a littleness about him which you discovered and which did not and was fully convinced of his being in love with arriet t was through a series of strange blunders nd in return for your acknowledging so much will do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself arriet mith has some first rate qualities which rs lton is totally without n unpretending single minded artless girl infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as rs lton found arriet more conversable than expected mma was extremely gratified hey were interrupted by the bustle of r eston calling on every body to begin dancing again ome iss oodhouse iss tway iss airfax what are you all doing ome mma set your companions the example very body is lazy very body is asleep am ready said mma whenever am wanted hom are you going to dance with asked r nightley he hesitated a moment and then replied ith you if you will ask me ill you said he offering his hand ndeed will ou have shewn that you can dance and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper rother and sister no indeed his little explanation with r nightley gave mma considerable pleasure t was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy he was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the ltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike and his praise of arriet his concession in her favour was peculiarly gratifying he impertinence of the ltons which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions and she looked forward to another happy result the cure of arriet s infatuation rom arriet s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom she had strong hopes t seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened and she were enabled to see that r lton was not the superior creature she had believed him he fever was over and mma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy he depended on the evil feelings of the ltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite arriet rational rank hurchill not too much in love and r nightley not wanting to quarrel with her how very happy a summer must be before her he was not to see rank hurchill this morning e had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at artfield as he was to be at home by the middle of the day he did not regret it aving arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all to rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa when the great iron sweep gate opened and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together rank hurchill with arriet leaning on his arm actually arriet moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened arriet looked white and frightened and he was trying to cheer her he iron gates and the front door were not twenty yards asunder they were all three soon in the hall and arriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away young lady who faints must be recovered questions must be answered and surprizes be explained uch events are very interesting but the suspense of them cannot last long few minutes made mma acquainted with the whole iss mith and iss ickerton another parlour boarder at rs oddard s who had been also at the ball had walked out together and taken a road the ichmond road which though apparently public enough for safety had led them into alarm bout half a mile beyond ighbury making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms on each side it became for a considerable stretch very retired and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them on a broader patch of greensward by the side a party of gipsies child on the watch came towards them to beg and iss ickerton excessively frightened gave a great scream and calling on arriet to follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at the top and made the best of her way by a short cut back to ighbury ut poor arriet could not follow he had suffered very much from cramp after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless and in this state and exceedingly terrified she had been obliged to remain ow the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been more courageous must be doubtful but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted and arriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous and impertinent in look though not absolutely in word ore and more frightened she immediately promised them money and taking out her purse gave them a shilling and begged them not to want more or to use her ill he was then able to walk though but slowly and was moving away but her terror and her purse were too tempting and she was followed or rather surrounded by the whole gang demanding more n this state rank hurchill had found her she trembling and conditioning they loud and insolent y a most fortunate chance his leaving ighbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment he pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward and leave his horses to meet him by another road a mile or two beyond ighbury and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of iss ates and to have forgotten to restore them he had been obliged to stop at her door and go in for a few minutes he was therefore later than he had intended and being on foot was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them he terror which the woman and boy had been creating in arriet was then their own portion e had left them completely frightened and arriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak had just strength enough to reach artfield before her spirits were quite overcome t was his idea to bring her to artfield he had thought of no other place his was the amount of the whole story of his communication and of arriet s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech e dared not stay longer than to see her well these several delays left him not another minute to lose and mma engaging to give assurance of her safety to rs oddard and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to r nightley he set off with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself uch an adventure as this a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain o mma thought at least ould a linguist could a grammarian could even a mathematician have seen what she did have witnessed their appearance together and heard their history of it without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other ow much more must an imaginist like herself be on fire with speculation and foresight especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made t was a very extraordinary thing othing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory no rencontre no alarm of the kind and now it had happened to the very person and at the very hour when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her t certainly was very extraordinary nd knowing as she did the favourable state of mind of each at this period it struck her the more e was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself she just recovering from her mania for r lton t seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences t was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other n the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him while arriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror her naivete her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm with a sensibility amused and delighted and just at last after arriet s own account had been given he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of iss ickerton in the warmest terms very thing was to take its natural course however neither impelled nor assisted he would not stir a step nor drop a hint o she had had enough of interference here could be no harm in a scheme a mere passive scheme t was no more than a wish eyond it she would on no account proceed mma s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible ithin half an hour it was known all over ighbury t was the very event to engage those who talk most the young and the low and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news he last night s ball seemed lost in the gipsies oor r oodhouse trembled as he sat and as mma had foreseen would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again t was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and iss oodhouse for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after as well as iss mith were coming in during the rest of the day and he had the pleasure of returning for answer that they were all very indifferent which though not exactly true for she was perfectly well and arriet not much otherwise mma would not interfere with he had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man for she hardly knew what indisposition was and if he did not invent illnesses for her she could make no figure in a message he gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took themselves off in a hurry he young ladies of ighbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to mma and her nephews in her imagination it maintained its ground and enry and ohn were still asking every day for the story of arriet and the gipsies and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital very few days had passed after this adventure when arriet came one morning to mma with a small parcel in her hand and after sitting down and hesitating thus began iss oodhouse if you are at leisure have something that should like to tell you a sort of confession to make and then you know it will be over mma was a good deal surprized but begged her to speak here was a seriousness in arriet s manner which prepared her quite as much as her words for something more than ordinary t is my duty and am sure it is my wish she continued to have no reserves with you on this subject s am happily quite an altered creature in one respect it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it do not want to say more than is necessary am too much ashamed of having given way as have done and dare say you understand me es said mma hope do ow could so long a time be fancying myself cried arriet warmly t seems like madness can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now do not care whether meet him or not except that of the two had rather not see him and indeed would go any distance round to avoid him but do not envy his wife in the least neither admire her nor envy her as have done she is very charming dare say and all that but think her very ill tempered and disagreeable shall never forget her look the other night owever assure you iss oodhouse wish her no evil o let them be ever so happy together it will not give me another moment s pang and to convince you that have been speaking truth am now going to destroy what ought to have destroyed long ago what ought never to have kept know that very well blushing as she spoke owever now will destroy it all and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you may see how rational am grown annot you guess what this parcel holds said she with a conscious look ot the least in the world id he ever give you any thing o cannot call them gifts but they are things that have valued very much he held the parcel towards her and mma read the words ost precious treasures on the top er curiosity was greatly excited arriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience ithin abundance of silver paper was a pretty little unbridge ware box which arriet opened it was well lined with the softest cotton but excepting the cotton mma saw only a small piece of court plaister ow said arriet you must recollect o indeed do not ear me should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court plaister one of the very last times we ever met in it t was but a very few days before had my sore throat just before r and rs ohn nightley came think the very evening o not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending court plaister ut as you had none about you and knew had you desired me to supply him and so took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me nd so then in my nonsense could not help making a treasure of it so put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat y dearest arriet cried mma putting her hand before her face and jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself than can bear emember it ye remember it all now all except your saving this relic knew nothing of that till this moment but the cutting the finger and my recommending court plaister and saying had none about me h my sins my sins nd had plenty all the while in my pocket ne of my senseless tricks deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life ell sitting down again go on what else nd had you really some at hand yourself am sure never suspected it you did it so naturally nd so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake said mma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement nd secretly she added to herself ord bless me when should ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court plaister that rank hurchill had been pulling about never was equal to this ere resumed arriet turning to her box again here is something still more valuable mean that has been more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the court plaister never did mma was quite eager to see this superior treasure t was the end of an old pencil the part without any lead his was really his said arriet o not you remember one morning no dare say you do not ut one morning forget exactly the day but perhaps it was the uesday or ednesday before that evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book it was about spruce beer r nightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce beer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing ut kept my eye on it and as soon as dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment do remember it cried mma perfectly remember it alking about spruce beer h yes r nightley and both saying we liked it and r lton s seeming resolved to learn to like it too perfectly remember it top r nightley was standing just here was not he have an idea he was standing just here h do not know cannot recollect t is very odd but cannot recollect r lton was sitting here remember much about where am now ell go on h that s all have nothing more to shew you or to say except that am now going to throw them both behind the fire and wish you to see me do it y poor dear arriet and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things es simpleton as was but am quite ashamed of it now and wish could forget as easily as can burn them t was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married knew it was but had not resolution enough to part with them ut arriet is it necessary to burn the court plaister have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court plaister might be useful shall be happier to burn it replied arriet t has a disagreeable look to me must get rid of every thing here it goes and there is an end thank eaven of r lton nd when thought mma will there be a beginning of r hurchill he had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had told no fortune might be proved to have made arriet s bout a fortnight after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation and quite undesignedly mma was not thinking of it at the moment which made the information she received more valuable he merely said in the course of some trivial chat ell arriet whenever you marry would advise you to do so and so and thought no more of it till after a minute s silence she heard arriet say in a very serious tone shall never marry mma then looked up and immediately saw how it was and after a moment s debate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied ever marry his is a new resolution t is one that shall never change however fter another short hesitation hope it does not proceed from hope it is not in compliment to r lton r lton indeed cried arriet indignantly h no and mma could just catch the words so superior to r lton he then took a longer time for consideration hould she proceed no farther should she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing erhaps arriet might think her cold or angry if she did or perhaps if she were totally silent it might only drive arriet into asking her to hear too much and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly resolved he believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once all that she meant to say and know lain dealing was always best he had previously determined how far she would proceed on any application of the sort and it would be safer for both to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed he was decided and thus spoke arriet will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning our resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you s not it so h iss oodhouse believe me have not the presumption to suppose ndeed am not so mad ut it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially am not at all surprized at you arriet he service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart ervice oh it was such an inexpressible obligation he very recollection of it and all that felt at the time when saw him coming his noble look and my wretchedness before uch a change n one moment such a change rom perfect misery to perfect happiness t is very natural t is natural and it is honourable es honourable think to chuse so well and so gratefully ut that it will be a fortunate preference is more that can promise do not advise you to give way to it arriet do not by any means engage for its being returned onsider what you are about erhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you e observant of him et his behaviour be the guide of your sensations give you this caution now because shall never speak to you again on the subject am determined against all interference enceforward know nothing of the matter et no name ever pass our lips e were very wrong before we will be cautious now e is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature but yet arriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been matches of greater disparity ut take care of yourself would not have you too sanguine though however it may end be assured your raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste which shall always know how to value arriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude mma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend ts tendency would be to raise and refine her mind and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation n this state of schemes and hopes and connivance une opened upon artfield o ighbury in general it brought no material change he ltons were still talking of a visit from the ucklings and of the use to be made of their barouche landau and ane airfax was still at her grandmother s and as the return of the ampbells from reland was again delayed and ugust instead of idsummer fixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer provided at least she were able to defeat rs lton s activity in her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will r nightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly taken an early dislike to rank hurchill was only growing to dislike him more e began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of mma hat mma was his object appeared indisputable very thing declared it his own attentions his father s hints his mother in law s guarded silence it was all in unison words conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story ut while so many were devoting him to mma and mma herself making him over to arriet r nightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with ane airfax e could not understand it but there were symptoms of intelligence between them he thought so at least symptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning however he might wish to escape any of mma s errors of imagination he was not present when the suspicion first arose e was dining with the andalls family and ane at the ltons and he had seen a look more than a single look at iss airfax which from the admirer of iss oodhouse seemed somewhat out of place hen he was again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like owper and his fire at twilight yself creating what saw brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking of private understanding even between rank hurchill and ane e had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend his evening at artfield mma and arriet were going to walk he joined them and on returning they fell in with a larger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their exercise early as the weather threatened rain r and rs eston and their son iss ates and her niece who had accidentally met hey all united and on reaching artfield gates mma who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him he andalls party agreed to it immediately and after a pretty long speech from iss ates which few persons listened to she also found it possible to accept dear iss oodhouse s most obliging invitation s they were turning into the grounds r erry passed by on horseback he gentlemen spoke of his horse y the bye said rank hurchill to rs eston presently what became of r erry s plan of setting up his carriage rs eston looked surprized and said did not know that he ever had any such plan ay had it from you ou wrote me word of it three months ago e impossible ndeed you did remember it perfectly ou mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon rs erry had told somebody and was extremely happy about it t was owing to her persuasion as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm ou must remember it now pon my word never heard of it till this moment ever really never less me how could it be hen must have dreamt it but was completely persuaded iss mith you walk as if you were tired ou will not be sorry to find yourself at home hat is this hat is this cried r eston about erry and a carriage s erry going to set up his carriage rank am glad he can afford it ou had it from himself had you o sir replied his son laughing seem to have had it from nobody ery odd really was persuaded of rs eston s having mentioned it in one of her letters to nscombe many weeks ago with all these particulars but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream am a great dreamer dream of every body at ighbury when am away and when have gone through my particular friends then begin dreaming of r and rs erry t is odd though observed his father that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at nscombe erry s setting up his carriage and his wife s persuading him to it out of care for his health just what will happen have no doubt some time or other only a little premature hat an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream nd at others what a heap of absurdities it is ell rank your dream certainly shews that ighbury is in your thoughts when you are absent mma you are a great dreamer think mma was out of hearing he had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach of r eston s hint hy to own the truth cried iss ates who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes if must speak on this subject there is no denying that r rank hurchill might have do not mean to say that he did not dream it am sure have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if am questioned about it must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for rs erry herself mentioned it to my mother and the oles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days rs erry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed ane don t you remember grandmama s telling us of it when we got home forget where we had been walking to very likely to andalls yes think it was to andalls rs erry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed do not know who is not and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this never mentioned it to a soul that know of t the same time will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because know do sometimes pop out a thing before am aware am a talker you know am rather a talker and now and then have let a thing escape me which should not am not like ane wish were will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world here is she h just behind erfectly remember rs erry s coming xtraordinary dream indeed hey were entering the hall r nightley s eyes had preceded iss ates s in a glance at ane rom rank hurchill s face where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away he had involuntarily turned to hers but she was indeed behind and too busy with her shawl r eston had walked in he two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass r nightley suspected in rank hurchill the determination of catching her eye he seemed watching her intently in vain however if it were so ane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither here was no time for farther remark or explanation he dream must be borne with and r nightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which mma had introduced at artfield and which none but mma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use instead of the small sized embroke on which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded ea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move iss oodhouse said rank hurchill after examining a table behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters t used to stand here here is it his is a sort of dull looking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer e had great amusement with those letters one morning want to puzzle you again mma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves hey were rapidly forming words for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled he quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for r oodhouse who had often been distressed by the more animated sort which r eston had occasionally introduced and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure of the poor little boys or in fondly pointing out as he took up any stray letter near him how beautifully mma had written it rank hurchill placed a word before iss airfax he gave a slight glance round the table and applied herself to it rank was next to mma ane opposite to them and r nightley so placed as to see them all and it was his object to see as much as he could with as little apparent observation he word was discovered and with a faint smile pushed away f meant to be immediately mixed with the others and buried from sight she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across for it was not mixed and arriet eager after every fresh word and finding out none directly took it up and fell to work he was sitting by r nightley and turned to him for help he word was blunder and as arriet exultingly proclaimed it there was a blush on ane s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible r nightley connected it with the dream but how it could all be was beyond his comprehension ow the delicacy the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep e feared there must be some decided involvement isingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn hese letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick t was a child s play chosen to conceal a deeper game on rank hurchill s part ith great indignation did he continue to observe him with great alarm and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions e saw a short word prepared for mma and given to her with a look sly and demure e saw that mma had soon made it out and found it highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure for she said onsense for shame e heard rank hurchill next say with a glance towards ane will give it to her shall and as clearly heard mma opposing it with eager laughing warmth o no you must not you shall not indeed t was done however his gallant young man who seemed to love without feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed over the word to iss airfax and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it r nightley s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it and it was not long before he saw it to be ixon ane airfax s perception seemed to accompany his her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning the superior intelligence of those five letters so arranged he was evidently displeased looked up and seeing herself watched blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her and saying only did not know that proper names were allowed pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered er face was averted from those who had made the attack and turned towards her aunt ye very true my dear cried the latter though ane had not spoken a word was just going to say the same thing t is time for us to be going indeed he evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us y dear sir you are too obliging e really must wish you good night ane s alertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived he was immediately up and wanting to quit the table but so many were also moving that she could not get away and r nightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her and resolutely swept away by her unexamined he was afterwards looking for her shawl rank hurchill was looking also it was growing dusk and the room was in confusion and how they parted r nightley could not tell e remained at artfield after all the rest his thoughts full of what he had seen so full that when the candles came to assist his observations he must yes he certainly must as a friend an anxious friend give mma some hint ask her some question e could not see her in a situation of such danger without trying to preserve her t was his duty ray mma said he may ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and iss airfax saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other mma was extremely confused he could not endure to give him the true explanation for though her suspicions were by no means removed she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them h she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves he joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you and r hurchill e had hoped she would speak again but she did not he would rather busy herself about any thing than speak e sat a little while in doubt variety of evils crossed his mind nterference fruitless interference mma s confusion and the acknowledged intimacy seemed to declare her affection engaged et he would speak e owed it to her to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference rather than her welfare to encounter any thing rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause y dear mma said he at last with earnest kindness do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of etween r rank hurchill and iss airfax h yes perfectly hy do you make a doubt of it ave you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her or that she admired him ever never she cried with a most open eagerness ever for the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me nd how could it possibly come into your head have lately imagined that saw symptoms of attachment between them certain expressive looks which did not believe meant to be public h you amuse me excessively am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander but it will not do very sorry to check you in your first essay but indeed it will not do here is no admiration between them do assure you and the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some peculiar circumstances feelings rather of a totally different nature it is impossible exactly to explain there is a good deal of nonsense in it but the part which is capable of being communicated which is sense is that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another as any two beings in the world can be hat is presume it to be so on her side and can answer for its being so on his will answer for the gentleman s indifference he spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction which silenced r nightley he was in gay spirits and would have prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her but his gaiety did not meet hers e found he could not be useful and his feelings were too much irritated for talking hat he might not be irritated into an absolute fever by the fire which r oodhouse s tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon afterwards took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness and solitude of onwell bbey fter being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from r and rs uckling the ighbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn o such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present n the daily interchange of news they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the ucklings coming had been united such as the last accounts of rs hurchill whose health seemed every day to supply a different report and the situation of rs eston whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it rs lton was very much disappointed t was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade er introductions and recommendations must all wait and every projected party be still only talked of o she thought at first but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off hy should not they explore to ox ill though the ucklings did not come hey could go there again with them in the autumn t was settled that they should go to ox ill hat there was to be such a party had been long generally known it had even given the idea of another mma had never been to ox ill she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing and she and r eston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither wo or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to be done in a quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking and picnic parade of the ltons and the ucklings his was so very well understood between them that mma could not but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing from r eston that he had been proposing to rs lton as her brother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite and go together and that as rs lton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she had no objection ow as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of rs lton of which r eston must already be perfectly aware it was not worth bringing forward again it could not be done without a reproof to him which would be giving pain to his wife and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of rs lton s party very feeling was offended and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of r eston s temper am glad you approve of what have done said he very comfortably ut thought you would uch schemes as these are nothing without numbers ne cannot have too large a party large party secures its own amusement nd she is a good natured woman after all ne could not leave her out mma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private t was now the middle of une and the weather fine and rs lton was growing impatient to name the day and settle with r eston as to pigeon pies and cold lamb when a lame carriage horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty t might be weeks it might be only a few days before the horse were useable but no preparations could be ventured on and it was all melancholy stagnation rs lton s resources were inadequate to such an attack s not this most vexations nightley she cried nd such weather for exploring hese delays and disappointments are quite odious hat are we to do he year will wear away at this rate and nothing done efore this time last year assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from aple rove to ings eston ou had better explore to onwell replied r nightley hat may be done without horses ome and eat my strawberries hey are ripening fast f r nightley did not begin seriously he was obliged to proceed so for his proposal was caught at with delight and the h should like it of all things was not plainer in words than manner onwell was famous for its strawberry beds which seemed a plea for the invitation but no plea was necessary cabbage beds would have been enough to tempt the lady who only wanted to be going somewhere he promised him again and again to come much oftener than he doubted and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it ou may depend upon me said she certainly will come ame your day and will come ou will allow me to bring ane airfax cannot name a day said he till have spoken to some others whom would wish to meet you h leave all that to me nly give me a carte blanche am ady atroness you know t is my party will bring friends with me hope you will bring lton said he but will not trouble you to give any other invitations h now you are looking very sly ut consider you need not be afraid of delegating power to me am no young lady on her preferment arried women you know may be safely authorised t is my party eave it all to me will invite your guests o he calmly replied there is but one married woman in the world whom can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to onwell and that one is rs eston suppose interrupted rs lton rather mortified o rs nightley and till she is in being will manage such matters myself h you are an odd creature she cried satisfied to have no one preferred to herself ou are a humourist and may say what you like uite a humourist ell shall bring ane with me ane and her aunt he rest leave to you have no objections at all to meeting

like t is to be a morning scheme you know nightley quite a simple thing shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm ere probably this basket with pink ribbon othing can be more simple you see nd ane will have such another here is to be no form or parade a sort of gipsy party e are to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under trees and whatever else you may like to provide it is to be all out of doors a table spread in the shade you know very thing as natural and simple as possible s not that your idea ot quite y idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining room he nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture think is best observed by meals within doors hen you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house ell as you please only don t have a great set out nd by the bye can or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion ray be sincere nightley f you wish me to talk to rs odges or to inspect anything have not the least wish for it thank you ell but if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely clever will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever and would spurn any body s assistance wish we had a donkey he thing would be for us all to come on donkeys ane iss ates and me and my caro sposo walking by really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey n a country life conceive it to be a sort of necessary for let a woman have ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home and very long walks you know in summer there is dust and in winter there is dirt ou will not find either between onwell and ighbury onwell ane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry ome on a donkey however if you prefer it ou can borrow rs ole s would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible hat am sure you would ndeed do you justice my good friend nder that peculiar sort of dry blunt manner know you have the warmest heart s tell r you are a thorough humourist es believe me nightley am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme ou have hit upon the very thing to please me r nightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade e wished to persuade r oodhouse as well as mma to join the party and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill r oodhouse must not under the specious pretence of a morning drive and an hour or two spent at onwell be tempted away to his misery e was invited on good faith o lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity e did consent e had not been at onwell for two years ome very fine morning he and mma and arriet could go very well and he could sit still with rs eston while the dear girls walked about the gardens e did not suppose they could be damp now in the middle of the day e should like to see the old house again exceedingly and should be very happy to meet r and rs lton and any other of his neighbours e could not see any objection at all to his and mma s and arriet s going there some very fine morning e thought it very well done of r nightley to invite them very kind and sensible much cleverer than dining out e was not fond of dining out r nightley was fortunate in every body s most ready concurrence he invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if like rs lton they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves mma and arriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it and r eston unasked promised to get rank over to join them if possible a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with r nightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him and r eston engaged to lose no time in writing and spare no arguments to induce him to come n the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party to ox ill was again under happy consideration and at last onwell was settled for one day and ox ill for the next the weather appearing exactly right nder a bright mid day sun at almost idsummer r oodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down to partake of this al fresco party and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the bbey especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning he was happily placed quite at his ease ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved and advise every body to come and sit down and not to heat themselves rs eston who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired and sit all the time with him remained when all the others were invited or persuaded out his patient listener and sympathiser t was so long since mma had been at the bbey that as soon as she was satisfied of her father s comfort she was glad to leave him and look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family he felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building its suitable becoming characteristic situation low and sheltered its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream of which the bbey with all the old neglect of prospect had scarcely a sight and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up he house was larger than artfield and totally unlike it covering a good deal of ground rambling and irregular with many comfortable and one or two handsome rooms t was just what it ought to be and it looked what it was and mma felt an increasing respect for it as the residence of a family of such true gentility untainted in blood and understanding ome faults of temper ohn nightley had but sabella had connected herself unexceptionably he had given them neither men nor names nor places that could raise a blush hese were pleasant feelings and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did and collect round the strawberry beds he whole party were assembled excepting rank hurchill who was expected every moment from ichmond and rs lton in all her apparatus of happiness her large bonnet and her basket was very ready to lead the way in gathering accepting or talking strawberries and only strawberries could now be thought or spoken of he best fruit in ngland every body s favourite always wholesome hese the finest beds and finest sorts elightful to gather for one s self the only way of really enjoying them orning decidedly the best time never tired every sort good hautboy infinitely superior no comparison the others hardly eatable hautboys very scarce hili preferred white wood finest flavour of all price of strawberries in ondon abundance about ristol aple rove cultivation beds when to be renewed gardeners thinking exactly different no general rule gardeners never to be put out of their way delicious fruit only too rich to be eaten much of inferior to cherries currants more refreshing only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping glaring sun tired to death could bear it no longer must go and sit in the shade uch for half an hour was the conversation interrupted only once by rs eston who came out in her solicitude after her son in law to inquire if he were come and she was a little uneasy he had some fears of his horse eats tolerably in the shade were found and now mma was obliged to overhear what rs lton and ane airfax were talking of situation a most desirable situation was in question rs lton had received notice of it that morning and was in raptures t was not with rs uckling it was not with rs ragge but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them it was with a cousin of rs ragge an acquaintance of rs uckling a lady known at aple rove elightful charming superior first circles spheres lines ranks every thing and rs lton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately n her side all was warmth energy and triumph and she positively refused to take her friend s negative though iss airfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before till rs lton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow s post ow ane could bear it at all was astonishing to mma he did look vexed she did speak pointedly and at last with a decision of action unusual to her proposed a removal hould not they walk ould not r nightley shew them the gardens all the gardens he wished to see the whole extent he pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear t was hot and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered dispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds t led to nothing nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars which seemed intended in their erection to give the appearance of an approach to the house which never had been there isputable however as might be the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view which closed it extremely pretty he considerable slope at nearly the foot of which the bbey stood gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood and at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the bbey ill arm with meadows in front and the river making a close and handsome curve around it t was a sweet view sweet to the eye and the mind nglish verdure nglish culture nglish comfort seen under a sun bright without being oppressive n this walk mma and r eston found all the others assembled and towards this view she immediately perceived r nightley and arriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way r nightley and arriet t was an odd tete a tete but she was glad to see it here had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion and turned from her with little ceremony ow they seemed in pleasant conversation here had been a time also when mma would have been sorry to see arriet in a spot so favourable for the bbey ill arm but now she feared it not t might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in blossom and light column of smoke ascending he joined them at the wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around e was giving arriet information as to modes of agriculture etc and mma received a smile which seemed to say hese are my own concerns have a right to talk on such subjects without being suspected of introducing obert artin he did not suspect him t was too old a story obert artin had probably ceased to think of arriet hey took a few turns together along the walk he shade was most refreshing and mma found it the pleasantest part of the day he next remove was to the house they must all go in and eat and they were all seated and busy and still rank hurchill did not come rs eston looked and looked in vain is father would not own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare e had expressed himself as to coming with more than common certainty is aunt was so much better that he had not a doubt of getting over to them rs hurchill s state however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence and rs eston was at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be by some attack of rs hurchill that he was prevented coming mma looked at arriet while the point was under consideration she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion he cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen the old bbey fish ponds perhaps get as far as the clover which was to be begun cutting on the morrow or at any rate have the pleasure of being hot and growing cool again r oodhouse who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens where no damps from the river were imagined even by him stirred no more and his daughter resolved to remain with him that rs eston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need r nightley had done all in his power for r oodhouse s entertainment ooks of engravings drawers of medals cameos corals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets had been prepared for his old friend to while away the morning and the kindness had perfectly answered r oodhouse had been exceedingly well amused rs eston had been shewing them all to him and now he would shew them all to mma fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child than in a total want of taste for what he saw for he was slow constant and methodical efore this second looking over was begun however mma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments free observation of the entrance and ground plot of the house and was hardly there when ane airfax appeared coming quickly in from the garden and with a look of escape ittle expecting to meet iss oodhouse so soon there was a start at first but iss oodhouse was the very person she was in quest of ill you be so kind said she when am missed as to say that am gone home am going this moment y aunt is not aware how late it is nor how long we have been absent but am sure we shall be wanted and am determined to go directly have said nothing about it to any body t would only be giving trouble and distress ome are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk ill they all come in shall not be missed and when they do will you have the goodness to say that am gone ertainly if you wish it but you are not going to walk to ighbury alone es what should hurt me walk fast shall be at home in twenty minutes ut it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone et my father s servant go with you et me order the carriage t can be round in five minutes hank you thank you but on no account would rather walk nd for me to be afraid of walking alone who may so soon have to guard others he spoke with great agitation and mma very feelingly replied hat can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now must order the carriage he heat even would be danger ou are fatigued already am she answered am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatigue quick walking will refresh me iss oodhouse we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits ine confess are exhausted he greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have my own way and only say that am gone when it is necessary mma had not another word to oppose he saw it all and entering into her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend er parting look was grateful and her parting words h iss oodhouse the comfort of being sometimes alone seemed to burst from an overcharged heart and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her even towards some of those who loved her best uch a home indeed such an aunt said mma as she turned back into the hall again do pity you nd the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors the more shall like you ane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had only accomplished some views of t ark s lace enice when rank hurchill entered the room mma had not been thinking of him she had forgotten to think of him but she was very glad to see him rs eston would be at ease he black mare was blameless they were right who had named rs hurchill as the cause e had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her a nervous seizure which had lasted some hours and he had quite given up every thought of coming till very late and had he known how hot a ride he should have and how late with all his hurry he must be he believed he should not have come at all he heat was excessive he had never suffered any thing like it almost wished he had staid at home nothing killed him like heat he could bear any degree of cold etc but heat was intolerable and he sat down at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of r oodhouse s fire looking very deplorable ou will soon be cooler if you sit still said mma s soon as am cooler shall go back again could very ill be spared but such a point had been made of my coming ou will all be going soon suppose the whole party breaking up met one as came adness in such weather absolute madness mma listened and looked and soon perceived that rank hurchill s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour ome people were always cross when they were hot uch might be his constitution and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints she recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance of every thing in the dining room and she humanely pointed out the door o he should not eat e was not hungry it would only make him hotter n two minutes however he relented in his own favour and muttering something about spruce beer walked off mma returned all her attention to her father saying in secret am glad have done being in love with him should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning arriet s sweet easy temper will not mind it e was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal and came back all the better grown quite cool and with good manners like himself able to draw a chair close to them take an interest in their employment and regret in a reasonable way that he should be so late e was not in his best spirits but seemed trying to improve them and at last made himself talk nonsense very agreeably hey were looking over views in wisserland s soon as my aunt gets well shall go abroad said he shall never be easy till have seen some of these places ou will have my sketches some time or other to look at or my tour to read or my poem shall do something to expose myself hat may be but not by sketches in wisserland ou will never go to wisserland our uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave ngland hey may be induced to go too warm climate may be prescribed for her have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad assure you have feel a strong persuasion this morning that shall soon be abroad ought to travel am tired of doing nothing want a change am serious iss oodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy am sick of ngland and would leave it to morrow if could ou are sick of prosperity and indulgence annot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay sick of prosperity and indulgence ou are quite mistaken do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged am thwarted in every thing material do not consider myself at all a fortunate person ou are not quite so miserable though as when you first came o and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well nother slice of cold meat another draught of adeira and water will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us o shall not stir shall sit by you ou are my best cure e are going to ox ill to morrow you will join us t is not wisserland but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change ou will stay and go with us o certainly not shall go home in the cool of the evening ut you may come again in the cool of to morrow morning o t will not be worth while f come shall be cross hen pray stay at ichmond ut if do shall be crosser still can never bear to think of you all there without me hese are difficulties which you must settle for yourself huse your own degree of crossness shall press you no more he rest of the party were now returning and all were soon collected ith some there was great joy at the sight of rank hurchill others took it very composedly but there was a very general distress and disturbance on iss airfax s disappearance being explained hat it was time for every body to go concluded the subject and with a short final arrangement for the next day s scheme they parted rank hurchill s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much that his last words to mma were ell if you wish me to stay and join the party will he smiled her acceptance and nothing less than a summons from ichmond was to take him back before the following evening hey had a very fine day for ox ill and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality were in favour of a pleasant party r eston directed the whole officiating safely between artfield and the icarage and every body was in good time mma and arriet went together iss ates and her niece with the ltons the gentlemen on horseback rs eston remained with r oodhouse othing was wanting but to be happy when they got there even miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency here was a languor a want of spirits a want of union which could not be got over hey separated too much into parties he ltons walked together r nightley took charge of iss ates and ane and mma and arriet belonged to rank hurchill nd r eston tried in vain to make them harmonise better t seemed at first an accidental division but it never materially varied r and rs lton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix and be as agreeable as they could but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill there seemed a principle of separation between the other parties too strong for any fine prospects or any cold collation or any cheerful r eston to remove t first it was downright dulness to mma he had never seen rank hurchill so silent and stupid e said nothing worth hearing looked without seeing admired without intelligence listened without knowing what she said hile he was so dull it was no wonder that arriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable hen they all sat down it was better to her taste a great deal better for rank hurchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object very distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her o amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared for and mma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered was gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance but which now in her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no nglish word but flirtation could very well describe r rank hurchill and iss oodhouse flirted together excessively hey were laying themselves open to that very phrase and to having it sent off in a letter to aple rove by one lady to reland by another ot that mma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected he laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning back her heart he still intended him for her friend ow much am obliged to you said he for telling me to come to day f it had not been for you should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party had quite determined to go away again es you were very cross and do not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries was a kinder friend than you deserved ut you were humble ou begged hard to be commanded to come on t say was cross was fatigued he heat overcame me t is hotter to day ot to my feelings am perfectly comfortable to day ou are comfortable because you are under command our command es erhaps intended you to say so but meant self command ou had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but to day you are got back again and as cannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine t comes to the same thing can have no self command without a motive ou order me whether you speak or not nd you can be always with me ou are always with me ating from three o clock yesterday y perpetual influence could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much out of humour before hree o clock yesterday hat is your date thought had seen you first in ebruary our gallantry is really unanswerable ut lowering her voice nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people say nothing of which am ashamed replied he with lively impudence saw you first in ebruary et every body on the ill hear me if they can et my accents swell to ickleham on one side and orking on the other saw you first in ebruary nd then whispering ur companions are excessively stupid hat shall we do to rouse them ny nonsense will serve hey shall talk adies and gentlemen am ordered by iss oodhouse who wherever she is presides to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ome laughed and answered good humouredly iss ates said a great deal rs lton swelled at the idea of iss oodhouse s presiding r nightley s answer was the most distinct s iss oodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of h no no cried mma laughing as carelessly as she could pon no account in the world t is the very last thing would stand the brunt of just now et me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of will not say quite all here are one or two perhaps glancing at r eston and arriet whose thoughts might not be afraid of knowing t is a sort of thing cried rs lton emphatically which should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into hough perhaps as the haperon of the party never was in any circle exploring parties young ladies married women er mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured in reply ery true my love very true xactly so indeed quite unheard of but some ladies say any thing etter pass it off as a joke very body knows what is due to you t will not do whispered rank to mma they are most of them affronted will attack them with more address adies and gentlemen am ordered by iss oodhouse to say that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you in a general way ere are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeated or two things moderately clever or three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily at them all h very well exclaimed iss ates then need not be uneasy hree things very dull indeed hat will just do for me you know shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever open my mouth shan t looking round with the most good humoured dependence on every body s assent o not you all think shall mma could not resist h ma am but there may be a difficulty ardon me but you will be limited as to number only three at once iss ates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not immediately catch her meaning but when it burst on her it could not anger though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her h well to be sure es see what she means turning to r nightley and will try to hold my tongue must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend like your plan cried r eston greed agreed will do my best am making a conundrum ow will a conundrum reckon ow am afraid sir very low answered his son but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way o no said mma it will not reckon low conundrum of r eston s shall clear him and his next neighbour ome sir pray let me hear it doubt its being very clever myself said r eston t is too much a matter of fact but here it is hat two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection hat two letters express perfection am sure do not know h you will never guess ou to mma am certain will never guess will tell you and m ma o you understand nderstanding and gratification came together t might be a very indifferent piece of wit but mma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it and so did rank and arriet t did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally some looked very stupid about it and r nightley gravely said his explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and r eston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else erfection should not have come quite so soon h for myself protest must be excused said rs lton really cannot attempt am not at all fond of the sort of thing had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which was not at all pleased with knew who it came from n abominable puppy ou know who mean nodding to her husband hese kind of things are very well at hristmas when one is sitting round the fire but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer iss oodhouse must excuse me am not one of those who have witty things at every body s service do not pretend to be a wit have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue ass us if you please r hurchill ass r nightley ane and myself e have nothing clever to say not one of us es yes pray pass me added her husband with a sort of sneering consciousness have nothing to say that can entertain iss oodhouse or any other young lady n old married man quite good for nothing hall we walk ugusta ith all my heart am really tired of exploring so long on one spot ome ane take my other arm ane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off appy couple said rank hurchill as soon as they were out of hearing ow well they suit one another ery lucky marrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place hey only knew each other think a few weeks in ath eculiarly lucky for as to any real knowledge of a person s disposition that ath or any public place can give it is all nothing there can be no knowledge t is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any just judgment hort of that it is all guess and luck and will generally be ill luck ow many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life iss airfax who had seldom spoken before except among her own confederates spoke now uch things do occur undoubtedly he was stopped by a cough rank hurchill turned towards her to listen ou were speaking said he gravely he recovered her voice was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women cannot imagine them to be very frequent hasty and imprudent attachment may arise but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever e made no answer merely looked and bowed in submission and soon afterwards said in a lively tone ell have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever marry hope some body will chuse my wife for me ill you turning to mma ill you chuse a wife for me am sure should like any body fixed on by you ou provide for the family you know with a smile at his father ind some body for me am in no hurry dopt her educate her nd make her like myself y all means if you can ery well undertake the commission ou shall have a charming wife he must be very lively and have hazle eyes care for nothing else shall go abroad for a couple of years and when return shall come to you for my wife emember mma was in no danger of forgetting t was a commission to touch every favourite feeling ould not arriet be the very creature described azle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished e might even have arriet in his thoughts at the moment who could say eferring the education to her seemed to imply it ow ma am said ane to her aunt shall we join rs lton f you please my dear ith all my heart am quite ready was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well e shall soon overtake her here she is no that s somebody else hat s one of the ladies in the rish car party not at all like her ell declare hey walked off followed in half a minute by r nightley r eston his son mma and arriet only remained and the young man s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant ven mma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone and quite unattended to in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her he appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart and the solicitude of rs lton to have her carriage first were gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure uch another scheme composed of so many ill assorted people she hoped never to be betrayed into again hile waiting for the carriage she found r nightley by her side e looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said mma must once more speak to you as have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but must still use it cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance ow could you be so unfeeling to iss ates ow could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation mma had not thought it possible mma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off ay how could help saying what did obody could have helped it t was not so very bad dare say she did not understand me assure you she did he felt your full meaning he has talked of it since wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candour and generosity wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome h cried mma know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her hey are blended said he acknowledge and were she prosperous could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good ere she a woman of fortune would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner ere she your equal in situation but mma consider how far this is from being the case he is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more er situation should secure your compassion t was badly done indeed ou whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her and before her niece too and before others many of whom certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment of her his is not pleasant to you mma and it is very far from pleasant to me but must will will tell you truths while can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now hile they talked they were advancing towards the carriage it was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in e had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted and her tongue motionless hey were combined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern he had not been able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back for a moment overcome then reproaching herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference but it was just too late e had turned away and the horses were in motion he continued to look back but in vain and soon with what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill and every thing left far behind he was vexed beyond what could have been expressed almost beyond what she could conceal ever had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life he was most forcibly struck he truth of this representation there was no denying he felt it at her heart ow could she have been so brutal so cruel to iss ates ow could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued nd how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness ime did not compose her s she reflected more she seemed but to feel it more he never had been so depressed appily it was not necessary to speak here was only arriet who seemed not in spirits herself fagged and very willing to be silent and mma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home without being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were he wretchedness of a scheme to ox ill was in mma s thoughts all the evening ow it might be considered by the rest of the party she could not tell hey in their different homes and their different ways might be looking back on it with pleasure but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection than any she had ever passed whole evening of back gammon with her father was felicity to it here indeed lay real pleasure for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty four to his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any severe reproach s a daughter she hoped she was not without a heart he hoped no one could have said to her ow could you be so unfeeling to your father must will tell you truths while can iss ates should never again no never f attention in future could do away the past she might hope to be forgiven he had been often remiss her conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought than fact scornful ungracious ut it should be so no more n the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the very next morning and it should be the beginning on her side of a regular equal kindly intercourse he was just as determined when the morrow came and went early that nothing might prevent her t was not unlikely she thought that she might see r nightley in her way or perhaps he might come in while she were paying her visit he had no objection he would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly and truly hers er eyes were towards onwell as she walked but she saw him not he ladies were all at home he had never rejoiced at the sound before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs with any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation or of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule here was a bustle on her approach a good deal of moving and talking he heard iss ates s voice something was to be done in a hurry the maid looked frightened and awkward hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment and then ushered her in too soon he aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room ane she had a distinct glimpse of looking extremely ill and before the door had shut them out she heard iss ates saying ell my dear shall say you are laid down upon the bed and am sure you are ill enough oor old rs ates civil and humble as usual looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on am afraid ane is not very well said she but do not know they tell me she is well dare say my daughter will be here presently iss oodhouse hope you find a chair wish etty had not gone am very little able ave you a chair ma am o you sit where you like am sure she will be here presently mma seriously hoped she would he had a moment s fear of iss ates keeping away from her ut iss ates soon came ery happy and obliged but mma s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before less ease of look and manner very friendly inquiry after iss airfax she hoped might lead the way to a return of old feelings he touch seemed immediate h iss oodhouse how kind you are suppose you have heard and are come to give us joy his does not seem much like joy indeed in me twinkling away a tear or two but it will be very trying for us to part with her after having had her so long and she has a dreadful headache just now writing all the morning such long letters you know to be written to olonel ampbell and rs ixon y dear said you will blind yourself for tears were in her eyes perpetually ne cannot wonder one cannot wonder t is a great change and though she is amazingly fortunate such a situation suppose as no young woman before ever met with on first going out do not think us ungrateful iss oodhouse for such surprising good fortune again dispersing her tears but poor dear soul if you were to see what a headache she has hen one is in great pain you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve he is as low as possible o look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation ou will excuse her not coming to you she is not able she is gone into her own room want her to lie down upon the bed y dear said shall say you are laid down upon the bed but however she is not she is walking about the room ut now that she has written her letters she says she shall soon be well he will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you iss oodhouse but your kindness will excuse her ou were kept waiting at the door was quite ashamed but somehow there was a little bustle for it so happened that we had not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did not know any body was coming t is only rs ole said depend upon it obody else would come so early ell said she it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now ut then atty came in and said it was you h said it is iss oodhouse am sure you will like to see her can see nobody said she and up she got and would go away and that was what made us keep you waiting and extremely sorry and ashamed we were f you must go my dear said you must and will say you are laid down upon the bed mma was most sincerely interested er heart had been long growing kinder towards ane and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing but pity and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past obliged her to admit that ane might very naturally resolve on seeing rs ole or any other steady friend when she might not bear to see herself he spoke as she felt with earnest regret and solicitude sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from iss ates to be now actually determined on might be as much for iss airfax s advantage and comfort as possible t must be a severe trial to them all he had understood it was to be delayed till olonel ampbell s return o very kind replied iss ates ut you are always kind here was no bearing such an always and to break through her dreadful gratitude mma made the direct inquiry of here may ask is iss airfax going o a rs mallridge charming woman most superior to have the charge of her three little girls delightful children mpossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort if we except perhaps rs uckling s own family and rs ragge s but rs mallridge is intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhood lives only four miles from aple rove ane will be only four miles from aple rove rs lton suppose has been the person to whom iss airfax owes es our good rs lton he most indefatigable true friend he would not take a denial he would not let ane say o for when ane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning we were at onwell when ane first heard of it she was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till olonel ampbell s return and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present and so she told rs lton over and over again and am sure had no more idea that she would change her mind but that good rs lton whose judgment never fails her saw farther than did t is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did and refuse to take ane s answer but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday as ane wished her she would wait and sure enough yesterday evening it was all settled that ane should go uite a surprize to me had not the least idea ane took rs lton aside and told her at once that upon thinking over the advantages of rs mallridge s situation she had come to the resolution of accepting it did not know a word of it till it was all settled ou spent the evening with rs lton es all of us rs lton would have us come t was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with r nightley ou must all spend your evening with us said she positively must have you all come r nightley was there too was he o not r nightley he declined it from the first and though thought he would come because rs lton declared she would not let him off he did not but my mother and ane and were all there and a very agreeable evening we had uch kind friends you know iss oodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning s party ven pleasure you know is fatiguing and cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it owever shall always think it a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it iss airfax suppose though you were not aware of it had been making up her mind the whole day dare say she had henever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends but hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible mean as to the character and manners of the family hank you dear iss oodhouse es indeed there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it xcept the ucklings and ragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal and elegant in all rs lton s acquaintance rs mallridge a most delightful woman style of living almost equal to aple rove and as to the children except the little ucklings and little ragges there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere ane will be treated with such regard and kindness t will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasure nd her salary really cannot venture to name her salary to you iss oodhouse ven you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like ane h madam cried mma if other children are at all like what remember to have been myself should think five times the amount of what have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly earned ou are so noble in your ideas nd when is iss airfax to leave you ery soon very soon indeed that s the worst of it ithin a fortnight rs mallridge is in a great hurry y poor mother does not know how to bear it o then try to put it out of her thoughts and say ome ma am do not let us think about it any more er friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not olonel and rs ampbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return es ane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to rs lton and when rs lton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it t was before tea stay no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards and yet it was before tea because remember thinking h no now recollect now have it something happened before tea but not that r lton was called out of the room before tea old ohn bdy s son wanted to speak with him oor old ohn have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty seven years and now poor old man he is bed ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints must go and see him to day and so will ane am sure if she gets out at all nd poor ohn s son came to talk to r lton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the rown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when r lton came back he told us what ohn ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to andalls to take r rank hurchill to ichmond hat was what happened before tea t was after tea that ane spoke to rs lton iss ates would hardly give mma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of r rank hurchill s going she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence hat r lton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the accumulation of the ostler s own knowledge and the knowledge of the servants at andalls was that a messenger had come over from ichmond soon after the return of the party from ox ill which messenger however had been no more than was expected and that r hurchill had sent his nephew a few lines containing upon the whole a tolerable account of rs hurchill and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early but that r rank hurchill having resolved to go home directly without waiting at all and his horse seeming to have got a cold om had been sent off immediately for the rown chaise and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy going a good pace and driving very steady here was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest and it caught mma s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind he contrast between rs hurchill s importance in the world and ane airfax s struck her one was every thing the other nothing and she sat musing on the difference of woman s destiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by iss ates s saying ye see what you are thinking of the pianoforte hat is to become of that ery true oor dear ane was talking of it just now ou must go said she ou and must part ou will have no business here et it stay however said she give it houseroom till olonel ampbell comes back shall talk about it to him he will settle for me he will help me out of all my difficulties nd to this day do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter s ow mma was obliged to think of the pianoforte and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough and with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt took leave mma s pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted but on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her r nightley and arriet had arrived during her absence and were sitting with her father r nightley immediately got up and in a manner decidedly graver than usual said would not go away without seeing you but have no time to spare and therefore must now be gone directly am going to ondon to spend a few days with ohn and sabella ave you any thing to send or say besides the love which nobody carries othing at all ut is not this a sudden scheme es rather have been thinking of it some little time mma was sure he had not forgiven her he looked unlike himself ime however she thought would tell him that they ought to be friends again hile he stood as if meaning to go but not going her father began his inquiries ell my dear and did you get there safely nd how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming ear mma has been to call on rs and iss ates r nightley as told you before he is always so attentive to them mma s colour was heightened by this unjust praise and with a smile and shake of the head which spoke much she looked at r nightley t seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour as if his eyes received the truth from her s and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured e looked at her with a glow of regard he was warmly gratified and in another moment still more so by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part e took her hand whether she had not herself made the first motion she could not say she might perhaps have rather offered it but he took her hand pressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips when from some fancy or other he suddenly let it go hy he should feel such a scruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done she could not perceive e would have judged better she thought if he had not stopped he intention however was indubitable and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry or however else it happened but she thought nothing became him more t was with him of so simple yet so dignified a nature he could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction t spoke such perfect amity e left them immediately afterwards gone in a moment e always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance mma could not regret her having gone to iss ates but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier it would have been a great pleasure to talk over ane airfax s situation with r nightley either would she regret that he should be going to runswick quare for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed but it might have happened at a better time and to have had longer notice of it would have been pleasanter hey parted thorough friends however she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance and his unfinished gallantry it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion e had been sitting with them half an hour she found t was a pity that she had not come back earlier n the hope of diverting her father s thoughts from the disagreeableness of r nightley s going to ondon and going so suddenly and going on horseback which she knew would be all very bad mma communicated her news of ane airfax and her dependence on the effect was justified it supplied a very useful check interested without disturbing him e had long made up his mind to ane airfax s going out as governess and could talk of it cheerfully but r nightley s going to ondon had been an unexpected blow am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled rs lton is very good natured and agreeable and dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care of t ought to be a first object as am sure poor iss aylor s always was with me ou know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what iss aylor was to us nd hope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long he following day brought news from ichmond to throw every thing else into the background n express arrived at andalls to announce the death of rs hurchill hough her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account she had not lived above six and thirty hours after his return sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state had carried her off after a short struggle he great rs hurchill was no more t was felt as such things must be felt very body had a degree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where she would be buried oldsmith tells us that when lovely woman stoops to folly she has nothing to do but to die and when she stoops to be disagreeable it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill fame rs hurchill after being disliked at least twenty five years was now spoken of with compassionate allowances n one point she was fully justified he had never been admitted before to be seriously ill he event acquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints oor rs hurchill no doubt she had been suffering a great deal more than any body had ever supposed and continual pain would try the temper t was a sad event a great shock with all her faults what would r hurchill do without her r hurchill s loss would be dreadful indeed r hurchill would never get over it ven r eston shook his head and looked solemn and said h poor woman who would have thought it and resolved that his mourning should be as handsome as possible and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense true and steady ow it would affect rank was among the earliest thoughts of both t was also a very early speculation with mma he character of rs hurchill the grief of her husband her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion and then rested with lightened feelings on how rank might be affected by the event how benefited how freed he saw in a moment all the possible good ow an attachment to arriet mith would have nothing to encounter r hurchill independent of his wife was feared by nobody an easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew ll that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form the attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause mma could feel no certainty of its being already formed arriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great self command hat ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing mma was gratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance hey spoke therefore of rs hurchill s death with mutual forbearance hort letters from rank were received at andalls communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans r hurchill was better than could be expected and their first removal on the departure of the funeral for orkshire was to be to the house of a very old friend in indsor to whom r hurchill had been promising a visit the last ten years t present there was nothing to be done for arriet good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on mma s side t was a more pressing concern to shew attention to ane airfax whose prospects were closing while arriet s opened and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at ighbury who wished to shew her kindness and with mma it was grown into a first wish he had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness and the person whom she had been so many months neglecting was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy he wanted to be of use to her wanted to shew a value for her society and testify respect and consideration he resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at artfield note was written to urge it he invitation was refused and by a verbal message iss airfax was not well enough to write and when r erry called at artfield the same morning it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited though against her own consent by himself and that she was suffering under severe headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made him doubt the possibility of her going to rs mallridge s at the time proposed er health seemed for the moment completely deranged appetite quite gone and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms nothing touching the pulmonary complaint which was the standing apprehension of the family r erry was uneasy about her e thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to and that she felt it so herself though she would not own it er spirits seemed overcome er present home he could not but observe was unfavourable to a nervous disorder confined always to one room he could have wished it otherwise and her good aunt though his very old friend he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description er care and attention could not be questioned they were in fact only too great e very much feared that iss airfax derived more evil than good from them mma listened with the warmest concern grieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful o take her be it only an hour or two from her aunt to give her change of air and scene and quiet rational conversation even for an hour or two might do her good and the following morning she wrote again to say in the most feeling language she could command that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that ane would name mentioning that she had r erry s decided opinion in favour of such exercise for his patient he answer was only in this short note iss airfax s compliments and thanks but is quite unequal to any exercise mma felt that her own note had deserved something better but it was impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted n spite of the answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove to rs ates s in the hope that ane would be induced to join her but it would not do iss ates came to the carriage door all gratitude and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service and every thing that message could do was tried but all in vain iss ates was obliged to return without success ane was quite unpersuadable the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse mma wished she could have seen her and tried her own powers but almost before she could hint the wish iss ates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let iss oodhouse in ndeed the truth was that poor dear ane could not bear to see any body any body at all rs lton indeed could not be denied and rs ole had made such a point and rs erry had said so much but except them ane would really see nobody mma did not want to be classed with the rs ltons the rs errys and the rs oles who would force themselves anywhere neither could she feel any right of preference herself she submitted therefore and only questioned iss ates farther as to her niece s appetite and diet which she longed to be able to assist n that subject poor iss ates was very unhappy and very communicative ane would hardly eat any thing r erry recommended nourishing food but every thing they could command and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful mma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an examination of her stores and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to iss ates with a most friendly note n half an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks from iss ates but dear ane would not be satisfied without its being sent back it was a thing she could not take and moreover she insisted on her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing hen mma afterwards heard that ane airfax had been seen wandering about the meadows at some distance from ighbury on the afternoon of the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal to any exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage she could have no doubt putting every thing together that ane was resolved to receive no kindness from her he was sorry very sorry er heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits inconsistency of action and inequality of powers and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling or esteemed so little worthy as a friend but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good and of being able to say to herself that could r nightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting ane airfax could he even have seen into her heart he would not on this occasion have found any thing to reprove ne morning about ten days after rs hurchill s decease mma was called downstairs to r eston who could not stay five minutes and wanted particularly to speak with her e met her at the parlour door and hardly asking her how she did in the natural key of his voice sunk it immediately to say unheard by her father an you come to andalls at any time this morning o if it be possible rs eston wants to see you he must see you s she unwell o no not at all only a little agitated he would have ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you alone and that you know nodding towards her father umph an you come ertainly his moment if you please t is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way ut what can be the matter s she really not ill epend upon me but ask no more questions ou will know it all in time he most unaccountable business ut hush hush o guess what all this meant was impossible even for mma omething really important seemed announced by his looks but as her friend was well she endeavoured not to be uneasy and settling it with her father that she would take her walk now she and r eston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for andalls ow said mma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates now r eston do let me know what has happened o no he gravely replied on t ask me promised my wife to leave it all to her he will break it to you better than can o not be impatient mma it will all come out too soon reak it to me cried mma standing still with terror ood od r eston tell me at once omething has happened in runswick quare know it has ell me charge you tell me this moment what it is o indeed you are mistaken r eston do not trifle with me onsider how many of my dearest friends are now in runswick quare hich of them is it charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment pon my word mma our word why not your honour why not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them ood eavens hat can be to be broke to me that does not relate to one of that family pon my honour said he very seriously it does not t is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of nightley mma s courage returned and she walked on was wrong he continued in talking of its being broke to you should not have used the expression n fact it does not concern you it concerns only myself that is we hope umph n short my dear mma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it don t say that it is not a disagreeable business but things might be much worse f we walk fast we shall soon be at andalls mma found that she must wait and now it required little effort he asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern something just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family something which the late event at ichmond had brought forward er fancy was very active alf a dozen natural children perhaps and poor rank cut off his though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her t inspired little more than an animating curiosity ho is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceeded speaking more to assist r eston in keeping his secret than with any other view do not know ne of the tways ot rank it is not rank assure you ou will not see him e is half way to indsor by this time as your son been with you then h yes did not you know ell well never mind or a moment he was silent and then added in a tone much more guarded and demure es rank came over this morning just to ask us how we did hey hurried on and were speedily at andalls ell my dear said he as they entered the room have brought her and now hope you will soon be better shall leave you together here is no use in delay shall not be far off if you want me nd mma distinctly heard him add in a lower tone before he quitted the room have been as good as my word he has not the least idea rs eston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation that mma s uneasiness increased and the moment they were alone she eagerly said hat is it my dear friend omething of a very unpleasant nature find has occurred do let me know directly what it is have been walking all this way in complete suspense e both abhor suspense o not let mine continue longer t will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be ave you indeed no idea said rs eston in a trembling voice annot you my dear mma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear o far as that it relates to r rank hurchill do guess ou are right t does relate to him and will tell you directly resuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up e has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand t is impossible to express our surprize e came to speak to his father on a subject to announce an attachment he stopped to breathe mma thought first of herself and then of arriet ore than an attachment indeed resumed rs eston an engagement a positive engagement hat will you say mma what will any body say when it is known that rank hurchill and iss airfax are engaged nay that they have been long engaged mma even jumped with surprize and horror struck exclaimed ane airfax ood od ou are not serious ou do not mean it ou may well be amazed returned rs eston still averting her eyes and talking on with eagerness that mma might have time to recover ou may well be amazed ut it is even so here has been a solemn engagement between them ever since ctober formed at eymouth and kept a secret from every body ot a creature knowing it but themselves neither the ampbells nor her family nor his t is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost incredible to myself can hardly believe it thought knew him mma scarcely heard what was said er mind was divided between two ideas her own former conversations with him about iss airfax and poor arriet and for some time she could only exclaim and require confirmation repeated confirmation ell said she at last trying to recover herself this is a circumstance which must think of at least half a day before can at all comprehend it hat engaged to her all the winter before either of them came to ighbury ngaged since ctober secretly engaged t has hurt me mma very much t has hurt his father equally ome part of his conduct we cannot excuse mma pondered a moment and then replied will not pretend not to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are apprehensive of rs eston looked up afraid to believe but mma s countenance was as steady as her words hat you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference she continued will farther tell you that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when did like him when was very much disposed to be attached to him nay was attached and how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder ortunately however it did cease have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him ou may believe me rs eston his is the simple truth rs eston kissed her with tears of joy and when she could find utterance assured her that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do r eston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she n this point we have been wretched t was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other and we were persuaded that it was so magine what we have been feeling on your account have escaped and that should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself ut this does not acquit him rs eston and must say that think him greatly to blame hat right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so very disengaged hat right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly did to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly did while he really belonged to another ow could he tell what mischief he might be doing ow could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him very wrong very wrong indeed rom something that he said my dear mma rather imagine nd how could she bear such behaviour omposure with a witness to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman before her face and not resent it hat is a degree of placidity which can neither comprehend nor respect here were misunderstandings between them mma he said so expressly e had not time to enter into much explanation e was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said he present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct mpropriety h rs eston it is too calm a censure uch much beyond impropriety t has sunk him cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion o unlike what a man should be one of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of his life ay dear mma now must take his part for though he has been wrong in this instance have known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities and ood od cried mma not attending to her rs mallridge too ane actually on the point of going as governess hat could he mean by such horrible indelicacy o suffer her to engage herself to suffer her even to think of such a measure e knew nothing about it mma n this article can fully acquit him t was a private resolution of hers not communicated to him or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction ill yesterday know he said he was in the dark as to her plans hey burst on him do not know how but by some letter or message and it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long mma began to listen better am to hear from him soon continued rs eston e told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now et us wait therefore for this letter t may bring many extenuations t may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood on t let us be severe don t let us be in a hurry to condemn him et us have patience must love him and now that am satisfied on one point the one material point am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may hey must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment is sufferings replied mma dryly do not appear to have done him much harm ell and how did r hurchill take it ost favourably for his nephew gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty onceive what the events of a week have done in that family hile poor rs hurchill lived suppose there could not have been a hope a chance a possibility but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required hat a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave e gave his consent with very little persuasion h thought mma he would have done as much for arriet his was settled last night and rank was off with the light this morning e stopped at ighbury at the ates s fancy some time and then came on hither but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever that as tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour e was very much agitated very much indeed to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing had ever seen him before n addition to all the rest there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion of and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal nd do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy he ampbells the ixons did none of them know of the engagement mma could not speak the name of ixon without a little blush one not one e positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves ell said mma suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea and wish them very happy ut shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding hat has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit espionage and treachery o come among us with professions of openness and simplicity and such a league in secret to judge us all ere have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear hey must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable am quite easy on that head replied rs eston am very sure that never said any thing of either to the other which both might not have heard ou are in luck our only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady rue ut as have always had a thoroughly good opinion of iss airfax never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him there must have been safe t this moment r eston appeared at a little distance from the window evidently on the watch is wife gave him a look which invited him in and while he was coming round added ow dearest mma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match et us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour t is not a connexion to gratify but if r hurchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for rank mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right nd how much may be said in her situation for even that error uch indeed cried mma feelingly f a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like ane airfax s f such one may almost say that the world is not their s nor the world s law he met r eston on his entrance with a smiling countenance exclaiming very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word his was a device suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing ut you really frightened me thought you had lost half your property at least nd here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation congratulate you r eston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in ngland for your daughter glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate is air and voice recovered their usual briskness he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered on the subject in a manner to prove that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing is companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence or smooth objections and by the time they had talked it all over together and he had talked it all over again with mma in their walk back to artfield he was become perfectly reconciled and not far from thinking it the very best thing that rank could possibly have done arriet poor arriet hose were the words in them lay the tormenting ideas which mma could not get rid of and which constituted the real misery of the business to her rank hurchill had behaved very ill by herself very ill in many ways but it was not so much his behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him t was the scrape which he had drawn her into on arriet s account that gave the deepest hue to his offence oor arriet to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery r nightley had spoken prophetically when he once said mma you have been no friend to arriet mith he was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice t was true that she had not to charge herself in this instance as in the former with being the sole and original author of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered arriet s imagination for arriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of rank hurchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed he might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments er influence would have been enough nd now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them he felt that she had been risking her friend s happiness on most insufficient grounds ommon sense would have directed her to tell arriet that she must not allow herself to think of him and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her ut with common sense she added am afraid have had little to do he was extremely angry with herself f she could not have been angry with rank hurchill too it would have been dreadful s for ane airfax she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account arriet would be anxiety enough she need no longer be unhappy about ane whose troubles and whose ill health having of course the same origin must be equally under cure er days of insignificance and evil were over he would soon be well and happy and prosperous mma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted his discovery laid many smaller matters open o doubt it had been from jealousy n ane s eyes she had been a rival and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed n airing in the artfield carriage would have been the rack and arrowroot from the artfield storeroom must have been poison he understood it all and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged that ane airfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert ut poor arriet was such an engrossing charge here was little sympathy to be spared for any body else mma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first onsidering the very superior claims of the object it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect on arriet s mind producing reserve and self command it would he must communicate the painful truth however and as soon as possible n injunction of secresy had been among r eston s parting words or the present the whole affair was to be completely a secret r hurchill had made a point of it as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum mma had promised but still arriet must be excepted t was her superior duty n spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by arriet which rs eston had just gone through by herself he intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her she was now to be anxiously announcing to another er heart beat quick on hearing arriet s footstep and voice so she supposed had poor rs eston felt when she was approaching andalls ould the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance ut of that unfortunately there could be no chance ell iss oodhouse cried arriet coming eagerly into the room is not this the oddest news that ever was hat news do you mean replied mma unable to guess by look or voice whether arriet could indeed have received any hint bout ane airfax id you ever hear any thing so strange h you need not be afraid of owning it to me for r eston has told me himself met him just now e told me it was to be a great secret and therefore should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it hat did r eston tell you said mma still perplexed h he told me all about it that ane airfax and r rank hurchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while ow very odd t was indeed so odd arriet s behaviour was so extremely odd that mma did not know how to understand it er character appeared absolutely changed he seemed to propose shewing no agitation or disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery mma looked at her quite unable to speak ad you any idea cried arriet of his being in love with her ou perhaps might ou blushing as she spoke who can see into every body s heart but nobody else pon my word said mma begin to doubt my having any such talent an you seriously ask me arriet whether imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that was tacitly if not openly encouraging you to give way to your own feelings never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of r rank hurchill s having the least regard for ane airfax ou may be very sure that if had should have cautioned you accordingly e cried arriet colouring and astonished hy should you caution me ou do not think care about r rank hurchill am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied mma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him im never never ear iss oodhouse how could you so mistake me turning away distressed arriet cried mma after a moment s pause hat do you mean ood eaven what do you mean istake you m to suppose then he could not speak another word er voice was lost and she sat down waiting in great terror till arriet should answer arriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned from her did not immediately say any thing and when she did speak it was in a voice nearly as agitated as mma s should not have thought it possible she began that you could have misunderstood me know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else should not have thought it possible that could be supposed to mean any other person r rank hurchill indeed do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other hope have a better taste than to think of r rank hurchill who is like nobody by his side nd that you should have been so mistaken is amazing am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him t first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words should not have dared to give way to should not have thought it possible ut if you who had been always acquainted with him arriet cried mma collecting herself resolutely et us understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake re you speaking of r nightley o be sure am never could have an idea of any body else and so thought you knew hen we talked about him it was as clear as possible ot quite returned mma with forced calmness for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person could almost assert that you had named r rank hurchill am sure the service r rank hurchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of h iss oodhouse how you do forget y dear arriet perfectly remember the substance of what said on the occasion told you that did not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely natural and you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue he impression of it is strong on my memory h dear cried arriet now recollect what you mean but was thinking of something very different at the time t was not the gipsies it was not r rank hurchill that meant o with some elevation was thinking of a much more precious circumstance of r nightley s coming and asking me to dance when r lton would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room hat was the kind action that was the noble benevolence and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth ood od cried mma this has been a most unfortunate most deplorable mistake hat is to be done ou would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me t least however cannot be worse off than should have been if the other had been the person and now it is possible he paused a few moments mma could not speak do not wonder iss oodhouse she resumed that you should feel a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body ou must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other ut hope iss oodhouse that supposing that if strange as it may appear ut you know they were your own words that more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than between r rank hurchill and me and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before and if should be so fortunate beyond expression as to if r nightley should really if he does not mind the disparity hope dear iss oodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way ut you are too good for that am sure arriet was standing at one of the windows mma turned round to look at her in consternation and hastily said ave you any idea of r nightley s returning your affection es replied arriet modestly but not fearfully must say that have mma s eyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating in a fixed attitude for a few minutes few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart mind like hers once opening to suspicion made rapid progress he touched she admitted she acknowledged the whole truth hy was it so much worse that arriet should be in love with r nightley than with rank hurchill hy was the evil so dreadfully increased by arriet s having some hope of a return t darted through her with the speed of an arrow that r nightley must marry no one but herself er own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the same few minutes he saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before ow improperly had she been acting by arriet ow inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling had been her conduct hat blindness what madness had led her on t struck her with dreadful force and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world ome portion of respect for herself however in spite of all these demerits some concern for her own appearance and a strong sense of justice by arriet there would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by r nightley but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now gave mma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness with even apparent kindness or her own advantage indeed it was fit that the utmost extent of arriet s hopes should be enquired into and arriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained or to deserve to be slighted by the person whose counsels had never led her right ousing from reflection therefore and subduing her emotion she turned to arriet again and in a more inviting accent renewed the conversation for as to the subject which had first introduced it the wonderful story of ane airfax that was quite sunk and lost either of them thought but of r nightley and themselves arriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad to be called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge and such a friend as iss oodhouse and only wanted invitation to give the history of her hopes with great though trembling delight mma s tremblings as she asked and as she listened were better concealed than arriet s but they were not less er voice was not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self such a burst of threatening evil such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions must create he listened with much inward suffering but with great outward patience to arriet s detail ethodical or well arranged or very well delivered it could not be expected to be but it contained when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration a substance to sink her spirit especially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory brought in favour of r nightley s most improved opinion of arriet arriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances mma knew that he had on that occasion found her much superior to his expectation rom that evening or at least from the time of iss oodhouse s encouraging her to think of him arriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her a manner of kindness and sweetness atterly she had been more and more aware of it hen they had been all walking together he had so often come and walked by her and talked so very delightfully e seemed to want to be acquainted with her mma knew it to have been very much the case he had often observed the change to almost the same extent arriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him and mma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of arriet e praised her for being without art or affectation for having simple honest generous feelings he knew that he saw such recommendations in arriet he had dwelt on them to her more than once uch that lived in arriet s memory many little particulars of the notice she had received from him a look a speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment implied a preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected by mma ircumstances that might swell to half an hour s relation and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned the two of strongest promise to arriet were not without some degree of witness from mma herself he first was his walking with her apart from the others in the lime walk at onwell where they had been walking some time before mma came and he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from the rest to himself and at first he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before in a very particular way indeed arriet could not recall it without a blush e seemed to be almost asking her whether her affections were engaged ut as soon as she iss oodhouse appeared likely to join them he changed the subject and began talking about farming he second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before mma came back from her visit the very last morning of his being at artfield though when he first came in he had said that he could not stay five minutes and his having told her during their conversation that though he must go to ondon it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all which was much more as mma felt than he had acknowledged to her he superior degree of confidence towards arriet which this one article marked gave her severe pain n the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did after a little reflection venture the following question ight he not s not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of your affections he might be alluding to r artin he might have r artin s interest in view ut arriet rejected the suspicion with spirit r artin o indeed here was not a hint of r artin hope know better now than to care for r artin or to be suspected of it hen arriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear iss oodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope never should have presumed to think of it at first said she but for you ou told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine and so have ut now seem to feel that may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful he bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings made the utmost exertion necessary on mma s side to enable her to say on reply arriet will only venture to declare that r nightley is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does arriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory and mma was only saved from raptures and fondness which at that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her father s footsteps e was coming through the hall arriet was too much agitated to encounter him he could not compose herself r oodhouse would be alarmed she had better go with most ready encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through another door and the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous burst of mma s feelings h od that had never seen her he rest of the day the following night were hardly enough for her thoughts he was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours very moment had brought a fresh surprize and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her ow to understand it all ow to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself and living under he blunders the blindness of her own head and heart she sat still she walked about she tried her own room she tried the shrubbery in every place every posture she perceived that she had acted most weakly that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying that she was wretched and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness o understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first endeavour o that point went every leisure moment which her father s claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary absence of mind ow long had r nightley been so dear to her as every feeling declared him now to be hen had his influence such influence begun hen had he succeeded to that place in her affection which rank hurchill had once for a short period occupied he looked back she compared the two compared them as they had always stood in her estimation from the time of the latter s becoming known to her and as they must at any time have been compared by her had it oh had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparison he saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider r nightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear he saw that in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her own heart and in short that she had never really cared for rank hurchill at all his was the conclusion of the first series of reflection his was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry which she reached and without being long in reaching it he was most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her her affection for r nightley very other part of her mind was disgusting ith insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body s feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body s destiny he was proved to have been universally mistaken and she had not quite done nothing for she had done mischief he had brought evil on arriet on herself and she too much feared on r nightley ere this most unequal of all connexions to take place on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning for his attachment she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of arriet s and even were this not the case he would never have known arriet at all but for her folly r nightley and arriet mith t was a union to distance every wonder of the kind he attachment of rank hurchill and ane airfax became commonplace threadbare stale in the comparison exciting no surprize presenting no disparity affording nothing to be said or thought r nightley and arriet mith uch an elevation on her side uch a debasement on his t was horrible to mma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion to foresee the smiles the sneers the merriment it would prompt at his expense the mortification and disdain of his brother the thousand inconveniences to himself ould it be o it was impossible nd yet it was far very far from impossible as it a new circumstance for a man of first rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers as it new for one perhaps too busy to seek to be the prize of a girl who would seek him as it new for any thing in this world to be unequal inconsistent incongruous or for chance and circumstance as second causes to direct the human fate h had she never brought arriet forward ad she left her where she ought and where he had told her she ought ad she not with a folly which no tongue could express prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong all would have been safe none of this dreadful sequel would have been ow arriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to r nightley ow she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it ut arriet was less humble had fewer scruples than formerly er inferiority whether of mind or situation seemed little felt he had seemed more sensible of r lton s being to stoop in marrying her than she now seemed of r nightley s las was not that her own doing too ho had been at pains to give arriet notions of self consequence but herself ho but herself had taught her that she was to elevate herself if possible and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment f arriet from being humble were grown vain it was her doing too ill now that she was threatened with its loss mma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being first with r nightley first in interest and affection atisfied that it was so and feeling it her due she had enjoyed it without reflection and only in the dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly important it had been ong very long she felt she had been first for having no female connexions of his own there had been only sabella whose claims could be compared with hers and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed sabella he had herself been first with him for many years past he had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own but still from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind he had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature had at all shared n spite of all her faults she knew she was dear to him might she not say very dear hen the suggestions of hope however which must follow here presented themselves she could not presume to indulge them arriet mith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly exclusively passionately loved by r nightley he could not he could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her he had received a very recent proof of its impartiality ow shocked had he been by her behaviour to iss ates ow directly how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject ot too strongly for the offence but far far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear sighted goodwill he had no hope nothing to deserve the name of hope that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question but there was a hope at times a slight one at times much stronger that arriet might have deceived herself and be overrating his regard for her ish it she must for his sake be the consequence nothing to herself but his remaining single all his life ould she be secure of that indeed of his never marrying at all she believed she should be perfectly satisfied et him but continue the same r nightley to her and her father the same r nightley to all the world let onwell and artfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence and her peace would be fully secured arriage in fact would not do for her t would be incompatible with what she owed to her father and with what she felt for him othing should separate her from her father he would not marry even if she were asked by r nightley t must be her ardent wish that arriet might be disappointed and she hoped that when able to see them together again she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were he should see them henceforward with the closest observance and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here e was expected back every day he power of observation would be soon given frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course n the meanwhile she resolved against seeing arriet t would do neither of them good it would do the subject no good to be talking of it farther he was resolved not to be convinced as long as she could doubt and yet had no authority for opposing arriet s confidence o talk would be only to irritate he wrote to her therefore kindly but decisively to beg that she would not at present come to artfield acknowledging it to be her conviction that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided and hoping that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again except in the company of others she objected only to a tete a tete they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday arriet submitted and approved and was grateful his point was just arranged when a visitor arrived to tear mma s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them sleeping or waking the last twenty four hours rs eston who had been calling on her daughter in law elect and took artfield in her way home almost as much in duty to mma as in pleasure to herself to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview r eston had accompanied her to rs ates s and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely but she having then induced iss airfax to join her in an airing was now returned with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction than a quarter of an hour spent in rs ates s parlour with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded little curiosity mma had and she made the most of it while her friend related rs eston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present to be allowed merely to write to iss airfax instead and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed and r hurchill could be reconciled to the engagement s becoming known as considering every thing she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports but r eston had thought differently he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to iss airfax and her family and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it or if it were that it would be of any consequence for such things he observed always got about mma smiled and felt that r eston had very good reason for saying so hey had gone in short and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady he had hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness he quiet heart felt satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight of her daughter who proved even too joyous to talk as usual had been a gratifying yet almost an affecting scene hey were both so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested in every sensation thought so much of ane so much of every body and so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them iss airfax s recent illness had offered a fair plea for rs eston to invite her to an airing she had drawn back and declined at first but on being pressed had yielded and in the course of their drive rs eston had by gentle encouragement overcome so much of her embarrassment as to bring her to converse on the important subject pologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and r eston must necessarily open the cause but when these effusions were put by they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement rs eston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject n the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment of so many months continued rs eston she was energetic his was one of her expressions will not say that since entered into the engagement have not had some happy moments but can say that have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour and the quivering lip mma which uttered it was an attestation that felt at my heart oor girl said mma he thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engagement rong o one believe can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself he consequence said she has been a state of perpetual suffering to me and so it ought ut after all the punishment that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct ain is no expiation never can be blameless have been acting contrary to all my sense of right and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken and the kindness am now receiving is what my conscience tells me ought not to be o not imagine madam she continued that was taught wrong o not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up he error has been all my own and do assure you that with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give shall yet dread making the story known to olonel ampbell oor girl said mma again he loves him then excessively suppose t must have been from attachment only that she could be led to form the engagement er affection must have overpowered her judgment es have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him am afraid returned mma sighing that must often have contributed to make her unhappy n your side my love it was very innocently done ut she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before ne natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in she said was that of making her unreasonable he consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been that had been hard for him to bear did not make the allowances said she which ought to have done for his temper and spirits his delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other circumstances would am sure have been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first he then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever had an opportunity to thank you could not thank you too much for every wish and every endeavour to do her good he was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself f did not know her to be happy now said mma seriously which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be could not bear these thanks for oh rs eston if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good have done iss airfax ell checking herself and trying to be more lively this is all to be forgotten ou are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars hey shew her to the greatest advantage am sure she is very good hope she will be very happy t is fit that the fortune should be on his side for think the merit will be all on hers uch a conclusion could not pass unanswered by rs eston he thought well of rank in almost every respect and what was more she loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest he talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection but she had too much to urge for mma s attention it was soon gone to runswick quare or to onwell she forgot to attempt to listen and when rs eston ended with e have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but hope it will soon come she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged to answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for re you well my mma was rs eston s parting question h perfectly am always well you know e sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible rs eston s communications furnished mma with more food for unpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion and her sense of past injustice towards iss airfax he bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure the cause ad she followed r nightley s known wishes in paying that attention to iss airfax which was every way her due had she tried to know her better had she done her part towards intimacy had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in arriet mith she must in all probability have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now irth abilities and education had been equally marking one as an associate for her to be received with gratitude and the other what was she upposing even that they had never become intimate friends that she had never been admitted into iss airfax s confidence on this important matter which was most probable still in knowing her as she ought and as she might she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to r ixon which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so unpardonably imparted an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of ane s feelings by the levity or carelessness of rank hurchill s f all the sources of evil surrounding the former since her coming to ighbury she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst he must have been a perpetual enemy hey never could have been all three together without her having stabbed ane airfax s peace in a thousand instances and on ox ill perhaps it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more he evening of this day was very long and melancholy at artfield he weather added what it could of gloom cold stormy rain set in and nothing of uly appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the wind was despoiling and the length of the day which only made such cruel sights the longer visible he weather affected r oodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter s side and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before t reminded her of their first forlorn tete a tete on the evening of rs eston s wedding day but r nightley had walked in then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy las such delightful proofs of artfield s attraction as those sort of visits conveyed might shortly be over he picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter had proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures had been lost ut her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction he prospect before her now was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled that might not be even partially brightened f all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends artfield must be comparatively deserted and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness he child to be born at andalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself and rs eston s heart and time would be occupied by it hey should lose her and probably in great measure her husband also rank hurchill would return among them no more and iss airfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease to belong to ighbury hey would be married and settled either at or near nscombe ll that were good would be withdrawn and if to these losses the loss of onwell were to be added what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach r nightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort o longer walking in at all hours as if ever willing to change his own home for their s ow was it to be endured nd if he were to be lost to them for arriet s sake if he were to be thought of hereafter as finding in arriet s society all that he wanted if arriet were to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence what could be increasing mma s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind that it had been all her own work hen it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain from a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room for a few seconds and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and leave her less to regret when it were gone he weather continued much the same all the following morning and the same loneliness and the same melancholy seemed to reign at artfield but in the afternoon it cleared the wind changed into a softer quarter the clouds were carried off the sun appeared it was summer again ith all the eagerness which such a transition gives mma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible ever had the exquisite sight smell sensation of nature tranquil warm and brilliant after a storm been more attractive to her he longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce and on r erry s coming in soon after dinner with a disengaged hour to give her father she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery here with spirits freshened and thoughts a little relieved she had taken a few turns when she saw r nightley passing through the garden door and coming towards her t was the first intimation of his being returned from ondon he had been thinking of him the moment before as unquestionably sixteen miles distant here was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind he must be collected and calm n half a minute they were together he ow d ye do s were quiet and constrained on each side he asked after their mutual friends they were all well hen had he left them nly that morning e must have had a wet ride es e meant to walk with her she found e had just looked into the dining room and as he was not wanted there preferred being out of doors he thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully and the first possible cause for it suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother and was pained by the manner in which they had been received hey walked together e was silent he thought he was often looking at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give nd this belief produced another dread erhaps he wanted to speak to her of his attachment to arriet he might be watching for encouragement to begin he did not could not feel equal to lead the way to any such subject e must do it all himself et she could not bear this silence ith him it was most unnatural he considered resolved and trying to smile began ou have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you ave said he quietly and looking at her of what nature h the best nature in the world a wedding fter waiting a moment as if to be sure she intended to say no more he replied f you mean iss airfax and rank hurchill have heard that already ow is it possible cried mma turning her glowing cheeks towards him for while she spoke it occurred to her that he might have called at rs oddard s in his way had a few lines on parish business from r eston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened mma was quite relieved and could presently say with a little more composure ou probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution wish had attended to it but with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh seem to have been doomed to blindness or a moment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest till she found her arm drawn within his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying in a tone of great sensibility speaking low ime my dearest mma time will heal the wound our own excellent sense your exertions for your father s sake know you will not allow yourself er arm was pressed again as he added in a more broken and subdued accent he feelings of the warmest friendship ndignation bominable scoundrel nd in a louder steadier tone he concluded with e will soon be gone hey will soon be in orkshire am sorry for her he deserves a better fate mma understood him and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure excited by such tender consideration replied ou are very kind but you are mistaken and must set you right am not in want of that sort of compassion y blindness to what was going on led me to act by them in a way that must always be ashamed of and was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but have no other reason to regret that was not in the secret earlier mma cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeed but checking himself o no understand you forgive me am pleased that you can say even so much e is no object of regret indeed and it will not be very long hope before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason ortunate that your affections were not farther entangled could never confess from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felt could only be certain that there was a preference and a preference which never believed him to deserve e is a disgrace to the name of man nd is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman ane ane you will be a miserable creature r nightley said mma trying to be lively but really confused am in a very extraordinary situation cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse ut never have e listened in perfect silence he wished him to speak but he would not he supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion he went on however have very little to say for my own conduct was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased n old story probably a common case and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as do for nderstanding any circumstances assisted the temptation e was the son of r eston he was continually here always found him very pleasant and in short for with a sigh let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at last my vanity was flattered and allowed his attentions atterly however for some time indeed have had no idea of their meaning any thing thought them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side e has imposed on me but he has not injured me have never been attached to him nd now can tolerably comprehend his behaviour e never wished to attach me t was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another t was his object to blind all about him and no one am sure could be more effectually blinded than myself except that was not blinded that it was my good fortune that in short was somehow or other safe from him he had hoped for an answer here for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible but he was silent and as far as she could judge deep in thought t last and tolerably in his usual tone he said have never had a high opinion of rank hurchill can suppose however that may have underrated him y acquaintance with him has been but trifling nd even if have not underrated him hitherto he may yet turn out well ith such a woman he has a chance have no motive for wishing him ill and for her sake whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct shall certainly wish him well have no doubt of their being happy together said mma believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached e is a most fortunate man returned r nightley with energy o early in life at three and twenty a period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill t three and twenty to have drawn such a prize hat years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him ssured of the love of such a woman the disinterested love for ane airfax s character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour equality of situation mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard must think be the happiest of mortals rank hurchill is indeed the favourite of fortune very thing turns out for his good e meets with a young woman at a watering place gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatment and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found her superior is aunt is in the way is aunt dies e has only to speak is friends are eager to promote his happiness e had used every body ill and they are all delighted to forgive him e is a fortunate man indeed ou speak as if you envied him nd do envy him mma n one respect he is the object of my envy mma could say no more hey seemed to be within half a sentence of arriet and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject if possible he made her plan she would speak of something totally different the children in runswick quare and she only waited for breath to begin when r nightley startled her by saying ou will not ask me what is the point of envy ou are determined see to have no curiosity ou are wise but cannot be wise mma must tell you what you will not ask though may wish it unsaid the next moment h then don t speak it don t speak it she eagerly cried ake a little time consider do not commit yourself hank you said he in an accent of deep mortification and not another syllable followed mma could not bear to give him pain e was wishing to confide in her perhaps to consult her cost her what it would she would listen he might assist his resolution or reconcile him to it she might give just praise to arriet or by representing to him his own independence relieve him from that state of indecision which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his hey had reached the house ou are going in suppose said he o replied mma quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke should like to take another turn r erry is not gone nd after proceeding a few steps she added stopped you ungraciously just now r nightley and am afraid gave you pain ut if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation as a friend indeed you may command me will hear whatever you like will tell you exactly what think s a friend repeated r nightley mma that fear is a word o have no wish tay yes why should hesitate have gone too far already for concealment mma accept your offer xtraordinary as it may seem accept it and refer myself to you as a friend ell me then have no chance of ever succeeding e stopped in his earnestness to look the question and the expression of his eyes overpowered her y dearest mma said he for dearest you will always be whatever the event of this hour s conversation my dearest most beloved mma tell me at once ay o if it is to be said he could really say nothing ou are silent he cried with great animation absolutely silent at present ask no more mma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment he dread of being awakened from the happiest dream was perhaps the most prominent feeling cannot make speeches mma he soon resumed and in a tone of such sincere decided intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing f loved you less might be able to talk about it more ut you know what am ou hear nothing but truth from me have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in ngland would have borne it ear with the truths would tell you now dearest mma as well as you have borne with them he manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them od knows have been a very indifferent lover ut you understand me es you see you understand my feelings and will return them if you can t present ask only to hear once to hear your voice hile he spoke mma s mind was most busy and with all the wonderful velocity of thought had been able and yet without losing a word to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole to see that arriet s hopes had been entirely groundless a mistake a delusion as complete a delusion as any of her own that arriet was nothing that she was every thing herself that what she had been saying relative to arriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings and that her agitation her doubts her reluctance her discouragement had been all received as discouragement from herself nd not only was there time for these convictions with all their glow of attendant happiness there was time also to rejoice that arriet s secret had not escaped her and to resolve that it need not and should not t was all the service she could now render her poor friend for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to arriet as infinitely the most worthy of the two or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever without vouchsafing any motive because he could not marry them both mma had it not he felt for arriet with pain and with contrition but no flight of generosity run mad opposing all that could be probable or reasonable entered her brain he had led her friend astray and it would be a reproach to her for ever but her judgment was as strong as her feelings and as strong as it had ever been before in reprobating any such alliance for him as most unequal and degrading er way was clear though not quite smooth he spoke then on being so entreated hat did she say ust what she ought of course lady always does he said enough to shew there need not be despair and to invite him to say more himself e had despaired at one period he had received such an injunction to caution and silence as for the time crushed every hope she had begun by refusing to hear him he change had perhaps been somewhat sudden her proposal of taking another turn her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to might be a little extraordinary he felt its inconsistency but r nightley was so obliging as to put up with it and seek no farther explanation eldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken but where as in this case though the conduct is mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very material r nightley could not impute to mma a more relenting heart than she possessed or a heart more disposed to accept of his e had in fact been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence e had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it e had come in his anxiety to see how she bore rank hurchill s engagement with no selfish view no view at all but of endeavouring if she allowed him an opening to soothe or to counsel her he rest had been the work of the moment the immediate effect of what he heard on his feelings he delightful assurance of her total indifference towards rank hurchill of her having a heart completely disengaged from him had given birth to the hope that in time he might gain her affection himself but it had been no present hope he had only in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her he superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting he affection which he had been asking to be allowed to create if he could was already his ithin half an hour he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind to something so like perfect happiness that it could bear no other name er change was equal his one half hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance jealousy or distrust n his side there had been a long standing jealousy old as the arrival or even the expectation of rank hurchill e had been in love with mma and jealous of rank hurchill from about the same period one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other t was his jealousy of rank hurchill that had taken him from the country he ox ill party had decided him on going away e would save himself from witnessing again such permitted encouraged attentions e had gone to learn to be indifferent ut he had gone to a wrong place here was too much domestic happiness in his brother s house woman wore too amiable a form in it sabella was too much like mma differing only in those striking inferiorities which always brought the other in brilliancy before him for much to have been done even had his time been longer e had stayed on however vigorously day after day till this very morning s post had conveyed the history of ane airfax hen with the gladness which must be felt nay which he did not scruple to feel having never believed rank hurchill to be at all deserving mma was there so much fond solicitude so much keen anxiety for her that he could stay no longer e had ridden home through the rain and had walked up directly after dinner to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures faultless in spite of all her faults bore the discovery e had found her agitated and low rank hurchill was a villain e heard her declare that she had never loved him rank hurchill s character was not desperate he was his own mma by hand and word when they returned into the house and if he could have thought of rank hurchill then he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow hat totally different feelings did mma take back into the house from what she had brought out she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away hey sat down to tea the same party round the same table how often it had been collected and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun ut never in such a state of spirits never in any thing like it and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house or even the attentive daughter oor r oodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride ould he have seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from r erry and talked on with much self contentment totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return s long as r nightley remained with them mma s fever continued but when he was gone she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued and in the course of the sleepless night which was the tax for such an evening she found one or two such very serious points to consider as made her feel that even her happiness must have some alloy er father and arriet he could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost was the question ith respect to her father it was a question soon answered he hardly knew yet what r nightley would ask but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father he even wept over the idea of it as a sin of thought hile he lived it must be only an engagement but she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of drawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him ow to do her best by arriet was of more difficult decision how to spare her from any unnecessary pain how to make her any possible atonement how to appear least her enemy n these subjects her perplexity and distress were very great and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it he could only resolve at last that she would still avoid a meeting with her and communicate all that need be told by letter that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from ighbury and indulging in one scheme more nearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to runswick quare sabella had been pleased with arriet and a few weeks spent in ondon must give her some amusement he did not think it in arriet s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety by the streets the shops and the children t any rate it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself from whom every thing was due a separation for the present an averting of the evil day when they must all be together again he rose early and wrote her letter to arriet an employment which left her so very serious so nearly sad that r nightley in walking up to artfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before e had not left her long by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else when a letter was brought her from andalls a very thick letter she guessed what it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it he was now in perfect charity with rank hurchill she wanted no explanations she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself and as for understanding any thing he wrote she was sure she was incapable of it t must be waded through however he opened the packet it was too surely so a note from rs eston to herself ushered in the letter from rank to rs eston have the greatest pleasure my dear mma in forwarding to you the enclosed know what thorough justice you will do it and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again but will not delay you by a long preface e are quite well his letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness have been feeling lately did not quite like your looks on uesday but it was an ungenial morning and though you will never own being affected by weather think every body feels a north east wind felt for your dear father very much in the storm of uesday afternoon and yesterday morning but had the comfort of hearing last night by r erry that it had not made him ill ours ever o rs eston f made myself intelligible yesterday this letter will be expected but expected or not know it will be read with candour and indulgence ou are all goodness and believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct ut have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent y courage rises while write t is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble have already met with such success in two applications for pardon that may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence ou must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when first arrived at andalls you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards his was the fact y right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment is another question shall not discuss it here or my temptation to think it a right refer every caviller to a brick house sashed windows below and casements above in ighbury dared not address her openly my difficulties in the then state of nscombe must be too well known to require definition and was fortunate enough to prevail before we parted at eymouth and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement ad she refused should have gone mad ut you will be ready to say what was your hope in doing this hat did you look forward to o any thing every thing to time chance circumstance slow effects sudden bursts perseverance and weariness health and sickness very possibility of good was before me and the first of blessings secured in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence f you need farther explanation have the honour my dear madam of being your husband s son and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of ee me then under these circumstances arriving on my first visit to andalls and here am conscious of wrong for that visit might have been sooner paid ou will look back and see that did not come till iss airfax was in ighbury and as you were the person slighted you will forgive me instantly but must work on my father s compassion by reminding him that so long as absented myself from his house so long lost the blessing of knowing you y behaviour during the very happy fortnight which spent with you did not hope lay me open to reprehension excepting on one point nd now come to the principal the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you which excites my own anxiety or requires very solicitous explanation ith the greatest respect and the warmest friendship do mention iss oodhouse my father perhaps will think ought to add with the deepest humiliation few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion and some censure acknowledge myself liable to y behaviour to iss oodhouse indicated believe more than it ought n order to assist a concealment so essential to me was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown cannot deny that iss oodhouse was my ostensible object but am sure you will believe the declaration that had not been convinced of her indifference would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on miable and delightful as iss oodhouse is she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me was as much my conviction as my wish he received my attentions with an easy friendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me e seemed to understand each other rom our relative situation those attentions were her due and were felt to be so hether iss oodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight cannot say when called to take leave of her remember that was within a moment of confessing the truth and then fancied she was not without suspicion but have no doubt of her having since detected me at least in some degree he may not have surmised the whole but her quickness must have penetrated a part cannot doubt it ou will find whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints that it did not take her wholly by surprize he frequently gave me hints of it remember her telling me at the ball that owed rs lton gratitude for her attentions to iss airfax hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss hile you considered me as having sinned against mma oodhouse could deserve nothing from either cquit me here and procure for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that said mma oodhouse whom regard with so much brotherly affection as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself hatever strange things said or did during that fortnight you have now a key to y heart was in ighbury and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion f you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account f the pianoforte so much talked of feel it only necessary to say that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to iss who would never have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her he delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement my dear madam is much beyond my power of doing justice to ou will soon earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself o description can describe her he must tell you herself what she is yet not by word for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit ince began this letter which will be longer than foresaw have heard from her he gives a good account of her own health but as she never complains dare not depend want to have your opinion of her looks know you will soon call on her she is living in dread of the visit erhaps it is paid already et me hear from you without delay am impatient for a thousand particulars emember how few minutes was at andalls and in how bewildered how mad a state and am not much better yet still insane either from happiness or misery hen think of the kindness and favour have met with of her excellence and patience and my uncle s generosity am mad with joy but when recollect all the uneasiness occasioned her and how little deserve to be forgiven am mad with anger f could but see her again ut must not propose it yet y uncle has been too good for me to encroach must still add to this long letter ou have not heard all that you ought to hear could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness and in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out needs explanation for though the event of the th ult as you will conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects should not have presumed on such early measures but from the very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement ut had no choice he hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman ere my dear madam was obliged to leave off abruptly to recollect and compose myself have been walking over the country and am now hope rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be t is in fact a most mortifying retrospect for me behaved shamefully nd here can admit that my manners to iss in being unpleasant to iss were highly blameable he disapproved them which ought to have been enough y plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient he was displeased thought unreasonably so thought her on a thousand occasions unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious thought her even cold ut she was always right f had followed her judgment and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper should have escaped the greatest unhappiness have ever known e quarrelled o you remember the morning spent at onwell here every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis was late met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her but she would not suffer it he absolutely refused to allow me which then thought most unreasonable ow however see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion hile to blind the world to our engagement was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless ad we been met walking together between onwell and ighbury the truth must have been suspected was mad enough however to resent doubted her affection doubted it more the next day on ox ill when provoked by such conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect of her and such apparent devotion to iss as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me n short my dear madam it was a quarrel blameless on her side abominable on mine and returned the same evening to ichmond though might have staid with you till the next morning merely because would be as angry with her as possible ven then was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time but was the injured person injured by her coldness and went away determined that she should make the first advances shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the ox ill party ad you witnessed my behaviour there can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again ts effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced as soon as she found was really gone from andalls she closed with the offer of that officious rs lton the whole system of whose treatment of her by the bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself but otherwise should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known ane indeed ou will observe that have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name even to you hink then what must have endured in hearing it bandied between the ltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of imaginary superiority ave patience with me shall soon have done he closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again he felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it his letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt s death answered it within an hour but from the confusion of my mind and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once my answer instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day was locked up in my writing desk and trusting that had written enough though but a few lines to satisfy her remained without any uneasiness was rather disappointed that did not hear from her again speedily but made excuses for her and was too busy and may add too cheerful in my views to be captious e removed to indsor and two days afterwards received a parcel from her my own letters all returned and a few lines at the same time by the post stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last and adding that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible she now sent me by a safe conveyance all my letters and requested that if could not directly command hers so as to send them to ighbury within a week would forward them after that period to her at in short the full direction to r mallridge s near ristol stared me in the face knew the name the place knew all about it and instantly saw what she had been doing t was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which knew her to possess and the secrecy she had maintained as to any such design in her former letter was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy or the world would not she have seemed to threaten me magine the shock imagine how till had actually detected my own blunder raved at the blunders of the post hat was to be done ne thing only must speak to my uncle ithout his sanction could not hope to be listened to again spoke circumstances were in my favour the late event had softened away his pride and he was earlier than could have anticipated wholly reconciled and complying and could say at last poor man with a deep sigh that he wished might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done felt that it would be of a different sort re you disposed to pity me for what must have suffered in opening the cause to him for my suspense while all was at stake o do not pity me till reached ighbury and saw how ill had made her o not pity me till saw her wan sick looks reached ighbury at the time of day when from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour was certain of a good chance of finding her alone was not disappointed and at last was not disappointed either in the object of my journey great deal of very reasonable very just displeasure had to persuade away ut it is done we are reconciled dearer much dearer than ever and no moment s uneasiness can ever occur between us again ow my dear madam will release you but could not conclude before thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her f you think me in a way to be happier than deserve am quite of your opinion iss calls me the child of good fortune hope she is right n one respect my good fortune is undoubted that of being able to subscribe myself our obliged and affectionate on his letter must make its way to mma s feelings he was obliged in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the justice that rs eston foretold s soon as she came to her own name it was irresistible every line relating to herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable and when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself by the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment he never stopt till she had gone through the whole and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed and he had suffered and was very sorry and he was so grateful to rs eston and so much in love with iss airfax and she was so happy herself that there was no being severe and could he have entered the room she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever he thought so well of the letter that when r nightley came again she desired him to read it he was sure of rs eston s wishing it to be communicated especially to one who like r nightley had seen so much to blame in his conduct shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long will take it home with me at night ut that would not do r eston was to call in the evening and she must return it by him would rather be talking to you he replied but as it seems a matter of justice it shall be done e began stopping however almost directly to say ad been offered the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few months ago mma it would not have been taken with such indifference e proceeded a little farther reading to himself and then with a smile observed umph a fine complimentary opening ut it is his way ne man s style must not be the rule of another s e will not be severe t will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my opinion aloud as read y doing it shall feel that am near you t will not be so great a loss of time but if you dislike it ot at all should wish it r nightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity e trifles here said he as to the temptation e knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge ad e ought not to have formed the engagement is father s disposition he is unjust however to his father r eston s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but r eston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it ery true he did not come till iss airfax was here nd have not forgotten said mma how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would ou pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right was not quite impartial in my judgment mma but yet think had you not been in the case should still have distrusted him hen he came to iss oodhouse he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud all that related to her with a smile a look a shake of the head a word or two of assent or disapprobation or merely of love as the subject required concluding however seriously and after steady reflection thus ery bad though it might have been worse laying a most dangerous game oo much indebted to the event for his acquittal o judge of his own manners by you lways deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience ancying you to have fathomed his secret atural enough his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others ystery inesse how they pervert the understanding y mma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other mma agreed to it and with a blush of sensibility on arriet s account which she could not give any sincere explanation of ou had better go on said she e did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte h hat was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure boyish scheme indeed cannot comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could fter this he made some progress without any pause rank hurchill s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing perfectly agree with you sir was then his remark ou did behave very shamefully ou never wrote a truer line nd having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement and his persisting to act in direct opposition to ane airfax s sense of right he made a fuller pause to say his is very bad e had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily he must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could e should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable e must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment mma knew that he was now getting to the ox ill party and grew uncomfortable er own behaviour had been so very improper he was deeply ashamed and a little afraid of his next look t was all read however steadily attentively and without the smallest remark and excepting one momentary glance at her instantly withdrawn in the fear of giving pain no remembrance of ox ill seemed to exist here is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the ltons was his next observation is feelings are natural hat actually resolve to break with him entirely he felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it hat a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour ell he must be a most extraordinary ay nay read on ou will find how very much he suffers hope he does replied r nightley coolly and resuming the letter mallridge hat does this mean hat is all this he had engaged to go as governess to rs mallridge s children a dear friend of rs lton s a neighbour of aple rove and by the bye wonder how rs lton bears the disappointment ay nothing my dear mma while you oblige me to read not even of rs lton nly one page more shall soon have done hat a letter the man writes wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him ell there is feeling here e does seem to have suffered in finding her ill ertainly can have no doubt of his being fond of her earer much dearer than ever hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation e is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands appier than deserve ome he knows himself there iss oodhouse calls me the child of good fortune hose were iss oodhouse s words were they nd a fine ending and there is the letter he child of good fortune hat was your name for him was it ou do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as am but still you must at least hope you must think the better of him for it hope it does him some service with you es certainly it does e has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness and am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to iss airfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her am very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants nd now let me talk to you of something else have another person s interest at present so much at heart that cannot think any longer about rank hurchill ver since left you this morning mma my mind has been hard at work on one subject he subject followed it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike nglish such as r nightley used even to the woman he was in love with how to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the happiness of her father mma s answer was ready at the first word hile her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible for her he could never quit him art only of this answer however was admitted he impossibility of her quitting her father r nightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility of any other change he could not agree to e had been thinking it over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce r oodhouse to remove with her to onwell he had wanted to believe it feasible but his knowledge of r oodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father s comfort perhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded r oodhouse taken from artfield o he felt that it ought not to be attempted ut the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted his dearest mma would not find in any respect objectionable it was that he should be received at artfield that so long as her father s happiness in other words his life required artfield to continue her home it should be his likewise f their all removing to onwell mma had already had her own passing thoughts ike him she had tried the scheme and rejected it but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her he was sensible of all the affection it evinced he felt that in quitting onwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there would be much very much to be borne with he promised to think of it and advised him to think of it more but he was fully convinced that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject e had given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration he had been walking away from illiam arkins the whole morning to have his thoughts to himself h there is one difficulty unprovided for cried mma am sure illiam arkins will not like it ou must get his consent before you ask mine he promised however to think of it and pretty nearly promised moreover to think of it with the intention of finding it a very good scheme t is remarkable that mma in the many very many points of view in which she was now beginning to consider onwell bbey was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew enry whose rights as heir expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded hink she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of r nightley s marrying ane airfax or any body else which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt his proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at artfield the more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became is evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase their mutual good to outweigh every drawback uch a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her uch a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy he would have been too happy but for poor arriet but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend who must now be even excluded from artfield he delightful family party which mma was securing for herself poor arriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at a distance from he would be a loser in every way mma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment n such a party arriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise but for the poor girl herself it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment n time of course r nightley would be forgotten that is supplanted but this could not be expected to happen very early r nightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure not like r lton r nightley always so kind so feeling so truly considerate for every body would never deserve to be less worshipped than now and it really was too much to hope even of arriet that she could be in love with more than three men in one year t was a very great relief to mma to find arriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting heir intercourse was painful enough by letter ow much worse had they been obliged to meet arriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed without reproaches or apparent sense of ill usage and yet mma fancied there was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in her style which increased the desirableness of their being separate t might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke he had no difficulty in procuring sabella s invitation and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it without resorting to invention here was a tooth amiss arriet really wished and had wished some time to consult a dentist rs ohn nightley was delighted to be of use any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her and though not so fond of a dentist as of a r ingfield she was quite eager to have arriet under her care hen it was thus settled on her sister s side mma proposed it to her friend and found her very persuadable arriet was to go she was invited for at least a fortnight she was to be conveyed in r oodhouse s carriage t was all arranged it was all completed and arriet was safe in runswick quare ow mma could indeed enjoy r nightley s visits now she could talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by that sense of injustice of guilt of something most painful which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her how much might at that moment and at a little distance be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself he difference of arriet at rs oddard s or in ondon made perhaps an unreasonable difference in mma s sensations but she could not think of her in ondon without objects of curiosity and employment which must be averting the past and carrying her out of herself he would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which arriet had occupied here was a communication before her one which she only could be competent to make the confession of her engagement to her father but she would have nothing to do with it at present he had resolved to defer the disclosure till rs eston were safe and well o additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time fortnight at least of leisure and peace of mind to crown every warmer but more agitating delight should be hers he soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on iss airfax he ought to go and she was longing to see her the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill t would be a secret satisfaction but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing ane might communicate he went she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had not been into the house since the morning after ox ill when poor ane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected he fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured of their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her name he heard atty announcing it but no such bustle succeeded as poor iss ates had before made so happily intelligible o she heard nothing but the instant reply of eg her to walk up and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by ane herself coming eagerly forward as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient mma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging here was consciousness animation and warmth there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted he came forward with an offered hand and said in a low but very feeling tone his is most kind indeed iss oodhouse it is impossible for me to express hope you will believe xcuse me for being so entirely without words mma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words if the sound of rs lton s voice from the sitting room had not checked her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest shake of the hand rs ates and rs lton were together iss ates was out which accounted for the previous tranquillity mma could have wished rs lton elsewhere but she was in a humour to have patience with every body and as rs lton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm he soon believed herself to penetrate rs lton s thoughts and understand why she was like herself in happy spirits it was being in iss airfax s confidence and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people mma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face and while paying her own compliments to rs ates and appearing to attend to the good old lady s replies she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to iss airfax and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods e can finish this some other time you know ou and shall not want opportunities nd in fact you have heard all the essential already only wanted to prove to you that rs admits our apology and is not offended ou see how delightfully she writes h she is a sweet creature ou would have doated on her had you gone ut not a word more et us be discreet quite on our good behaviour ush ou remember those lines forget the poem at this moment or when a lady s in the case ou know all other things give place ow say my dear in our case for lady read mum a word to the wise am in a fine flow of spirits an t ut want to set your heart at ease as to rs y representation you see has quite appeased her nd again on mma s merely turning her head to look at rs ates s knitting she added in a half whisper mentioned no names you will observe h no cautious as a minister of state managed it extremely well mma could not doubt t was a palpable display repeated on every possible occasion hen they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and rs eston she found herself abruptly addressed with o not you think iss oodhouse our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered o not you think her cure does erry the highest credit here was a side glance of great meaning at ane pon my word erry has restored her in a wonderful short time h if you had seen her as did when she was at the worst nd when rs ates was saying something to mma whispered farther e do not say a word of any assistance that erry might have not a word of a certain young physician from indsor h no erry shall have all the credit have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you iss oodhouse she shortly afterwards began since the party to ox ill ery pleasant party ut yet think there was something wanting hings did not seem that is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some o it appeared to me at least but might be mistaken owever think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again hat say you both to our collecting the same party and exploring to ox ill again while the fine weather lasts t must be the same party you know quite the same party not one exception oon after this iss ates came in and mma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say every thing hank you dear iss oodhouse you are all kindness t is impossible to say es indeed quite understand dearest ane s prospects that is do not mean ut she is charmingly recovered ow is r oodhouse am so glad uite out of my power uch a happy little circle as you find us here es indeed harming young man that is so very friendly mean good r erry such attention to ane nd from her great her more than commonly thankful delight towards rs lton for being there mma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards ane from the vicarage quarter which was now graciously overcome fter a few whispers indeed which placed it beyond a guess rs lton speaking louder said es here am my good friend and here have been so long that anywhere else should think it necessary to apologise but the truth is that am waiting for my lord and master e promised to join me here and pay his respects to you hat are we to have the pleasure of a call from r lton hat will be a favour indeed for know gentlemen do not like morning visits and r lton s time is so engaged pon my word it is iss ates e really is engaged from morning to night here is no end of people s coming to him on some pretence or other he magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always wanting his opinion hey seem not able to do any thing without him pon my word r often say rather you than do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument if had half so many applicants ad enough as it is for absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree believe have not played a bar this fortnight owever he is coming assure you yes indeed on purpose to wait on you all nd putting up her hand to screen her words from mma congratulatory visit you know h yes quite indispensable iss ates looked about her so happily e promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from nightley but he and nightley are shut up together in deep consultation r is nightley s right hand mma would not have smiled for the world and only said s r lton gone on foot to onwell e will have a hot walk h no it is a meeting at the rown a regular meeting eston and ole will be there too but one is apt to speak only of those who lead fancy r and nightley have every thing their own way ave not you mistaken the day said mma am almost certain that the meeting at the rown is not till to morrow r nightley was at artfield yesterday and spoke of it as for aturday h no the meeting is certainly to day was the abrupt answer which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on rs lton s side do believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish that ever was e never heard of such things at aple rove our parish there was small said ane pon my word my dear do not know for never heard the subject talked of ut it is proved by the smallness of the school which have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and rs ragge the only school and not more than five and twenty children h you clever creature that s very true hat a thinking brain you have say ane what a perfect character you and should make if we could be shaken together y liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection ot that presume to insinuate however that some people may not think you perfection already ut hush not a word if you please t seemed an unnecessary caution ane was wanting to give her words not to rs lton but to iss oodhouse as the latter plainly saw he wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted was very evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look r lton made his appearance is lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity ery pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come ut you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with ou knew should not stir till my lord and master appeared ere have been sitting this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience for who can say you know how soon it may be wanted r lton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away is civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the walk he had had for nothing hen got to onwell said he nightley could not be found ery odd very unaccountable after the note sent him this morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one onwell cried his wife y dear r you have not been to onwell ou mean the rown you come from the meeting at the rown o no that s to morrow and particularly wanted to see nightley to day on that very account uch a dreadful broiling morning went over the fields too speaking in a tone of great ill usage which made it so much the worse nd then not to find him at home assure you am not at all pleased nd no apology left no message for me he housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected ery extraordinary nd nobody knew at all which way he was gone erhaps to artfield perhaps to the bbey ill perhaps into his woods iss oodhouse this is not like our friend nightley an you explain it mma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary indeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him cannot imagine said rs lton feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world he very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten y dear r he must have left a message for you am sure he must ot even nightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it epend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the onwell servants who are all have often observed extremely awkward and remiss am sure would not have such a creature as his arry stand at our sideboard for any consideration nd as for rs odges right holds her very cheap indeed he promised right a receipt and never sent it met illiam arkins continued r lton as got near the house and he told me should not find his master at home but did not believe him illiam seemed rather out of humour e did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him have nothing to do with illiam s wants but it really is of very great importance that should see nightley to day and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that should have had this hot walk to no purpose mma felt that she could not do better than go home directly n all probability she was at this very time waited for there and r nightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards r lton if not towards illiam arkins he was pleased on taking leave to find iss airfax determined to attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of to say t is as well perhaps that have not had the possibility ad you not been surrounded by other friends might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct feel that should certainly have been impertinent h cried ane with a blush and an hesitation which mma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure there would have been no danger he danger would have been of my wearying you ou could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest ndeed iss oodhouse speaking more collectedly with the consciousness which have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as to have not time for half that could wish to say long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself feel it so very due ut unfortunately in short if your compassion does not stand my friend h you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried mma warmly and taking her hand ou owe me no apologies and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted even ou are very kind but know what my manners were to you o cold and artificial had always a part to act t was a life of deceit know that must have disgusted you ray say no more feel that all the apologies should be on my side et us forgive each other at once e must do whatever is to be done quickest and think our feelings will lose no time there hope you have pleasant accounts from indsor ery nd the next news suppose will be that we are to lose you just as begin to know you h as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet am here till claimed by olonel and rs ampbell othing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied mma smiling but excuse me it must be thought of he smile was returned as ane answered ou are very right it has been thought of nd will own to you am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with r hurchill at nscombe it is settled here must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over imagine there will be nothing more to wait for hank you thank you his is just what wanted to be assured of h if you knew how much love every thing that is decided and open ood bye good bye rs eston s friends were all made happy by her safety and if the satisfaction of her well doing could be increased to mma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl he had been decided in wishing for a iss eston he would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of sabella s sons but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best t would be a great comfort to r eston as he grew older and even r eston might be growing older ten years hence to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home and rs eston no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have their powers in exercise again he has had the advantage you know of practising on me she continued like a aronne d lmane on a omtesse d stalis in adame de enlis delaide and heodore and we shall now see her own little delaide educated on a more perfect plan hat is replied r nightley she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all t will be the only difference oor child cried mma at that rate what will become of her othing very bad he fate of thousands he will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest mma who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them mma laughed and replied ut had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it o you have no doubt ature gave you understanding iss aylor gave you principles ou must have done well y interference was quite as likely to do harm as good t was very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me and am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner do not believe did you any good he good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least am sure you were of use to me cried mma was very often influenced rightly by you oftener than would own at the time am very sure you did me good nd if poor little nna eston is to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen ow often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks r nightley am going to do so and so papa says may or have iss aylor s leave something which you knew did not approve n such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one hat an amiable creature was o wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance r nightley ou always called me r nightley and from habit it has not so very formal a sound nd yet it is formal want you to call me something else but do not know what remember once calling you eorge in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago did it because thought it would offend you but as you made no objection never did it again nd cannot you call me eorge now mpossible never can call you any thing but r nightley will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of rs lton by calling you r ut will promise she added presently laughing and blushing will promise to call you once by your hristian name do not say when but perhaps you may guess where in the building in which takes for better for worse mma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies her wilful intimacy with arriet mith but it was too tender a subject he could not enter on it arriet was very seldom mentioned between them his on his side might merely proceed from her not being thought of but mma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were declining he was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on sabella s letters e might observe that it was so he pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little inferior to the pain of having made arriet unhappy sabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits which appeared perfectly natural as there was a dentist to be consulted but since that business had been over she did not appear to find arriet different from what she had known her before sabella to be sure was no very quick observer yet if arriet had not been equal to playing with the children it would not have escaped her mma s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on by arriet s being to stay longer her fortnight was likely to be a month at least r and rs ohn nightley were to come down in ugust and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back ohn does not even mention your friend said r nightley ere is his answer if you like to see it t was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage mma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned ohn enters like a brother into my happiness continued r nightley but he is no complimenter and though well know him to have likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise ut am not afraid of your seeing what he writes e writes like a sensible man replied mma when she had read the letter honour his sincerity t is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already ad he said any thing to bear a different construction should not have believed him y mma he means no such thing e only means e and should differ very little in our estimation of the two interrupted she with a sort of serious smile much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject mma my dear mma h she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion epend upon it he will be much farther from doing you justice e will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine wish may not sink into poor mma with him at once is tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther h he cried wish your father might be half as easily convinced as ohn will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together am amused by one part of ohn s letter did you notice it where he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind f understand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying e had no idea of me e seems perfectly unprepared for that es yes but am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings hat has he been judging by am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another ut it was so suppose dare say there was a difference when was staying with them the other day believe did not play with the children quite so much as usual remember one evening the poor boys saying ncle seems always tired now he time was coming when the news must spread farther and other persons reception of it tried s soon as rs eston was sufficiently recovered to admit r oodhouse s visits mma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause resolved first to announce it at home and then at andalls ut how to break it to her father at last he had bound herself to do it in such an hour of r nightley s absence or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her and she must have put it off but r nightley was to come at such a time and follow up the beginning she was to make he was forced to speak and to speak cheerfully too he must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself he must not appear to think it a misfortune ith all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtained which she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all she and r nightley meant to marry by which means artfield would receive the constant addition of that person s company whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and rs eston best in the world oor man it was at first a considerable shock to him and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it he was reminded more than once of having always said she would never marry and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single and told of poor sabella and poor iss aylor ut it would not do mma hung about him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so and that he must not class her with sabella and rs eston whose marriages taking them from artfield had indeed made a melancholy change but she was not going from artfield she should be always there she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having r nightley always at hand when he were once got used to the idea id he not love r nightley very much e would not deny that he did she was sure hom did he ever want to consult on business but r nightley ho was so useful to him who so ready to write his letters who so glad to assist him ho so cheerful so attentive so attached to him ould not he like to have him always on the spot es hat was all very true r nightley could not be there too often he should be glad to see him every day but they did see him every day as it was hy could not they go on as they had done r oodhouse could not be soon reconciled but the worst was overcome the idea was given time and continual repetition must do the rest o mma s entreaties and assurances succeeded r nightley s whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome and he was soon used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion hey had all the assistance which sabella could give by letters of the strongest approbation and rs eston was ready on the first meeting to consider the subject in the most serviceable light first as a settled and secondly as a good one well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to r oodhouse s mind t was agreed upon as what was to be and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it he began to think that some time or other in another year or two perhaps it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place rs eston was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event he had been extremely surprized never more so than when mma first opened the affair to her but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost he had such a regard for r nightley as to think he deserved even her dearest mma and it was in every respect so proper suitable and unexceptionable a connexion and in one respect one point of the highest importance so peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate that now it seemed as if mma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it and wished it long ago ow very few of those men in a rank of life to address mma would have renounced their own home for artfield nd who but r nightley could know and bear with r oodhouse so as to make such an arrangement desirable he difficulty of disposing of poor r oodhouse had been always felt in her husband s plans and her own for a marriage between rank and mma ow to settle the claims of nscombe and artfield had been a continual impediment less acknowledged by r eston than by herself but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying hose matters will take care of themselves the young people will find a way ut here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future t was all right all open all equal o sacrifice on any side worth the name t was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself and without one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it rs eston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections as these was one of the happiest women in the world f any thing could increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps he news was universally a surprize wherever it spread and r eston had his five minutes share of it but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind e saw the advantages of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife but the wonder of it was very soon nothing and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it t is to be a secret conclude said he hese matters are always a secret till it is found out that every body knows them nly let me be told when may speak out wonder whether ane has any suspicion e went to ighbury the next morning and satisfied himself on that point e told her the news as not she like a daughter his eldest daughter he must tell her and iss ates being present it passed of course to rs ole rs erry and rs lton immediately afterwards t was no more than the principals were prepared for they had calculated from the time of its being known at andalls how soon it would be over ighbury and were thinking of themselves as the evening wonder in many a family circle with great sagacity n general it was a very well approved match ome might think him and others might think her the most in luck ne set might recommend their all removing to onwell and leaving artfield for the ohn nightleys and another might predict disagreements among their servants but yet upon the whole there was no serious objection raised except in one habitation the icarage here the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction r lton cared little about it compared with his wife he only hoped the young lady s pride would now be contented and supposed she had always meant to catch nightley if she could and on the point of living at artfield could daringly exclaim ather he than ut rs lton was very much discomposed indeed oor nightley poor fellow sad business for him he was extremely concerned for though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualities ow could he be so taken in id not think him at all in love not in the least oor nightley here would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him ow happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him ut that would be all over now oor fellow o more exploring parties to onwell made for her h no there would be a rs nightley to throw cold water on every thing xtremely disagreeable ut she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day hocking plan living together t would never do he knew a family near aple rove who had tried it and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter ime passed on few more to morrows and the party from ondon would be arriving t was an alarming change and mma was thinking of it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when r nightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by fter the first chat of pleasure he was silent and then in a graver tone began with have something to tell you mma some news ood or bad said she quickly looking up in his face do not know which it ought to be called h good am sure see it in your countenance ou are trying not to smile am afraid said he composing his features am very much afraid my dear mma that you will not smile when you hear it ndeed but why so can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too here is one subject he replied hope but one on which we do not think alike e paused a moment again smiling with his eyes fixed on her face oes nothing occur to you o not you recollect arriet mith er cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though she knew not what ave you heard from her yourself this morning cried he ou have believe and know the whole o have not know nothing pray tell me ou are prepared for the worst see and very bad it is arriet mith marries obert artin mma gave a start which did not seem like being prepared and her eyes in eager gaze said o this is impossible but her lips were closed t is so indeed continued r nightley have it from obert artin himself e left me not half an hour ago he was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement ou like it my mma as little as feared wish our opinions were the same ut in time they will ime you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject ou mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself t is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but cannot believe it t seems an impossibility ou cannot mean to say that arriet mith has accepted obert artin ou cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again yet ou only mean that he intends it mean that he has done it answered r nightley with smiling but determined decision and been accepted ood od she cried ell hen having recourse to her workbasket in excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing she added ell now tell me every thing make this intelligible to me ow where when et me know it all never was more surprized but it does not make me unhappy assure you ow how has it been possible t is a very simple story e went to town on business three days ago and got him to take charge of some papers which was wanting to send to ohn e delivered these papers to ohn at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to stley s hey were going to take the two eldest boys to stley s he party was to be our brother and sister enry ohn and iss mith y friend obert could not resist hey called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day which he did and in the course of that visit as understand he found an opportunity of speaking to arriet and certainly did not speak in vain he made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving e came down by yesterday s coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own his is all that can relate of the how where and when our friend arriet will make a much longer history when you see her he will give you all the minute particulars which only woman s language can make interesting n our communications we deal only in the great owever must say that obert artin s heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at stley s my brother took charge of rs ohn nightley and little ohn and he followed with iss mith and enry and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make iss mith rather uneasy e stopped mma dared not attempt any immediate reply o speak she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness he must wait a moment or he would think her mad er silence disturbed him and after observing her a little while he added mma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected is situation is an evil but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more is good sense and good principles would delight you s far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands is rank in society would alter if could which is saying a great deal assure you mma ou laugh at me about illiam arkins but could quite as ill spare obert artin e wanted her to look up and smile and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly she did cheerfully answering ou need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match think arriet is doing extremely well er connexions may be worse than his n respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize ou cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly unprepared was for had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before ou ought to know your friend best replied r nightley but should say she was a good tempered soft hearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her mma could not help laughing as she answered pon my word believe you know her quite as well as do ut r nightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him could suppose she might in time but can she already id not you misunderstand him ou were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drills and might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake him t was not arriet s hand that he was certain of it was the dimensions of some famous ox he contrast between the countenance and air of r nightley and obert artin was at this moment so strong to mma s feelings and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on arriet s side so fresh the sound of those words spoken with such emphasis o hope know better than to think of obert artin that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove in some measure premature t could not be otherwise o you dare say this cried r nightley o you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of hat do you deserve h always deserve the best treatment because never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer re you quite sure that you understand the terms on which r artin and arriet now are am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and think can give you a proof that it must be so e asked my opinion as to what he was now to do e knew of no one but rs oddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends ould mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to rs oddard assured him that could not hen he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day am perfectly satisfied replied mma with the brightest smiles and most sincerely wish them happy ou are materially changed since we talked on this subject before hope so for at that time was a fool nd am changed also for am now very willing to grant you all arriet s good qualities have taken some pains for your sake and for obert artin s sake whom have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her have often talked to her a good deal ou must have seen that did ometimes indeed have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor artin s cause which was never the case but from all my observations am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life uch of this have no doubt she may thank you for e cried mma shaking her head h poor arriet he checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved heir conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father he was not sorry he wanted to be alone er mind was in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be collected he was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits and till she had moved about and talked to herself and laughed and reflected she could be fit for nothing rational er father s business was to announce ames s being gone out to put the horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to andalls and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing he joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined he sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of arriet s welfare she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security hat had she to wish for othing but to grow more worthy of him whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own othing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future erious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her resolutions and yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the very midst of them he must laugh at such a close uch an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back uch a heart such a arriet ow there would be pleasure in her returning very thing would be a pleasure t would be a great pleasure to know obert artin igh in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from r nightley would soon be over he disguise equivocation mystery so hateful to her to practise might soon be over he could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty n the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father not always listening but always agreeing to what he said and whether in speech or silence conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to andalls every day or poor rs eston would be disappointed hey arrived rs eston was alone in the drawing room but hardly had they been told of the baby and r oodhouse received the thanks for coming which he asked for when a glimpse was caught through the blind of two figures passing near the window t is rank and iss airfax said rs eston was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning e stays till to morrow and iss airfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us hey are coming in hope n half a minute they were in the room mma was extremely glad to see him but there was a degree of confusion a number of embarrassing recollections on each side hey met readily and smiling but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said and having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that mma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long felt of seeing rank hurchill once more and of seeing him with ane would yield its proportion of pleasure hen r eston joined the party however and when the baby was fetched there was no longer a want of subject or animation or of courage and opportunity for rank hurchill to draw near her and say have to thank you iss oodhouse for a very kind forgiving message in one of rs eston s letters hope time has not made you less willing to pardon hope you do not retract what you then said o indeed cried mma most happy to begin not in the least am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you and to give you joy in person e thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness s not she looking well said he turning his eyes towards ane etter than she ever used to do ou see how my father and rs eston doat upon her ut his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes after mentioning the expected return of the ampbells he named the name of ixon mma blushed and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing can never think of it she cried without extreme shame he shame he answered is all mine or ought to be ut is it possible that you had no suspicion mean of late arly know you had none never had the smallest assure you hat appears quite wonderful was once very near and wish had it would have been better ut though was always doing wrong things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service t would have been a much better transgression had broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing t is not now worth a regret said mma have some hope resumed he of my uncle s being persuaded to pay a visit at andalls he wants to be introduced to her hen the ampbells are returned we shall meet them in ondon and continue there trust till we may carry her northward ut now am at such a distance from her is not it hard iss oodhouse ill this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation o not you pity me mma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession of gay thought he cried h by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for the moment hope r nightley is well e paused he coloured and laughed know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish in your favour et me return your congratulations assure you that have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction e is a man whom cannot presume to praise mma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own ane and his next words were id you ever see such a skin such smoothness such delicacy and yet without being actually fair ne cannot call her fair t is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eye lashes and hair a most distinguishing complexion o peculiarly the lady in it ust colour enough for beauty have always admired her complexion replied mma archly but do not remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale hen we first began to talk of her ave you quite forgotten h no what an impudent dog was ow could dare ut he laughed so heartily at the recollection that mma could not help saying do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all am sure you had am sure it was a consolation to you h no no no how can you suspect me of such a thing was the most miserable wretch ot quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all in erhaps am the readier to suspect because to tell you the truth think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation think there is a little likeness between us e bowed f not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of true sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own rue true he answered warmly o not true on your side ou can have no superior but most true on mine he is a complete angel ook at her s not she an angel in every gesture bserve the turn of her throat bserve her eyes as she is looking up at my father ou will be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously that my uncle means to give her all my aunt s jewels hey are to be new set am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head ill not it be beautiful in her dark hair ery beautiful indeed replied mma and she spoke so kindly that he gratefully burst out ow delighted am to see you again and to see you in such excellent looks would not have missed this meeting for the world should certainly have called at artfield had you failed to come he others had been talking of the child rs eston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under the evening before from the infant s appearing not quite well he believed she had been foolish but it had alarmed her and she had been within half a minute of sending for r erry erhaps she ought to be ashamed but r eston had been almost as uneasy as herself n ten minutes however the child had been perfectly well again his was her history and particularly interesting it was to r oodhouse who commended her very much for thinking of sending for erry and only regretted that she had not done it he should always send for erry if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered were it only for a moment he could not be too soon alarmed nor send for erry too often t was a pity perhaps that he had not come last night for though the child seemed well now very well considering it would probably have been better if erry had seen it rank hurchill caught the name erry said he to mma and trying as he spoke to catch iss airfax s eye y friend r erry hat are they saying about r erry as he been here this morning nd how does he travel now as he set up his carriage mma soon recollected and understood him and while she joined in the laugh it was evident from ane s countenance that she too was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf uch an extraordinary dream of mine he cried can never think of it without laughing he hears us she hears us iss oodhouse see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown ook at her o not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye that the whole blunder is spread before her that she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others ane was forced to smile completely for a moment and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious low yet steady voice ow you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me hey will sometimes obtrude but how you can court them e had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly but mma s feelings were chiefly with ane in the argument and on leaving andalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she felt that pleased as she had been to see rank hurchill and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more sensible of r nightley s high superiority of character he happiness of this most happy day received its completion in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced f mma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for arriet a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to r nightley and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty very few days brought the party from ondon and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with arriet than she became perfectly satisfied unaccountable as it was that obert artin had thoroughly supplanted r nightley and was now forming all her views of happiness arriet was a little distressed did look a little foolish at first but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly and self deceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words and leave her without a care for the past and with the fullest exultation in the present and future for as to her friend s approbation mma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations arriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at stley s and the dinner the next day she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight ut what did such particulars explain he fact was as mma could now acknowledge that arriet had always liked obert artin and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible eyond this it must ever be unintelligible to mma he event however was most joyful and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so arriet s parentage became known he proved to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent enough to have always wished for concealment uch was the blood of gentility which mma had formerly been so ready to vouch for t was likely to be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many a gentleman but what a connexion had she been preparing for r nightley or for the hurchills or even for r lton he stain of illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth would have been a stain indeed o objection was raised on the father s side the young man was treated liberally it was all as it should be and as mma became acquainted with obert artin who was now introduced at artfield she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend he had no doubt of arriet s happiness with any good tempered man but with him and in the home he offered there would be the hope of more of security stability and improvement he would be placed in the midst of those who loved her and who had better sense than herself retired enough for safety and occupied enough for cheerfulness he would be never led into temptation nor left for it to find her out he would be respectable and happy and mma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man or if not quite the luckiest to yield only to herself arriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the artins was less and less at artfield which was not to be regretted he intimacy between her and mma must sink their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill and fortunately what ought to be and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural manner efore the end of eptember mma attended arriet to church and saw her hand bestowed on obert artin with so complete a satisfaction as no remembrances even connected with r lton as he stood before them could impair erhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw r lton but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself obert artin and arriet mith the latest couple engaged of the three were the first to be married ane airfax had already quitted ighbury and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the ampbells he r hurchills were also in town and they were only waiting for ovember he intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by mma and r nightley hey had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while ohn and sabella were still at artfield to allow them the fortnight s absence in a tour to the seaside which was the plan ohn and sabella and every other friend were agreed in approving it ut r oodhouse how was r oodhouse to be induced to consent he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event hen first sounded on the subject he was so miserable that they were almost hopeless second allusion indeed gave less pain e began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent it a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation till however he was not happy ay he appeared so much otherwise that his daughter s courage failed he could not bear to see him suffering to know him fancying himself neglected and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the r nightleys that when once the event were over his distress would be soon over too she hesitated she could not proceed n this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden illumination of r oodhouse s mind or any wonderful change of his nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another way rs eston s poultry house was robbed one night of all her turkeys evidently by the ingenuity of man ther poultry yards in the neighbourhood also suffered ilfering was housebreaking to r oodhouse s fears e was very uneasy and but for the sense of his son in law s protection would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life he strength resolution and presence of mind of the r nightleys commanded his fullest dependence hile either of them protected him and his artfield was safe ut r ohn nightley must be in ondon again by the end of the first week in ovember he result of this distress was that with a much more voluntary cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment she was able to fix her wedding day and r lton was called on within a month from the marriage of r and rs obert artin to join the hands of r nightley and iss oodhouse he wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties have no taste for finery or parade and rs lton from the particulars detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby and very inferior to her own ery little white satin very few lace veils a most pitiful business elina would stare when she heard of it ut in spite of these deficiencies the wishes the hopes the confidence the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union\n",
